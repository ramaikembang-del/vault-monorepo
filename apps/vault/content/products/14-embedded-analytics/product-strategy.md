# Embedded Analytics Product Strategy
**White-Label Analytics via POS Partnerships**

**Product Code:** A3 (Pillar 1 - Acquisition)
**Target Segment:** Phase 1-3, via POS partner distribution
**Pricing:** Free for end-users (POS partners pay us)

---

## Purpose

Achieve massive distribution by embedding our analytics inside existing POS systems. Restaurants get analytics "for free" bundled with their POS.

## Key Features

- **White-label branding:** Appears as POS company's feature
- **Seamless integration:** No additional login, no separate app
- **Basic metrics:** 10-15 essential KPIs (revenue, top sellers, trends)
- **Upgrade CTA:** "Want more? Upgrade to full platform"

## Market Sizing

- **TAM:** 100K+ restaurants using Moka, Pawoon, Qasir, Olsera
- **SAM:** 50,000 POS users (tech-ready SMEs)
- **SOM:** 5,000-10,000 embedded users by Year 2 (via 1-2 POS partnerships)

## Business Model

| Partner Type | Revenue Model |
|--------------|---------------|
| POS Monthly Fee | Rp 500K-1M per 1,000 merchants |
| Revenue Share | 10-20% of analytics-driven upsells |
| Hybrid | Base fee + performance bonus |

## Strategic Value

- **Distribution leverage:** Reach 100K merchants we'd never acquire directly
- **Brand credibility:** "Powered by [Our Brand]" builds awareness
- **Upgrade pipeline:** Power users of embedded → direct sales target

## Dependencies (BLOCKED)

> [!CAUTION]
> This product requires POS partnership agreements. Currently **BLOCKED** until partnerships established.

**Required partnerships:**

- Year 1: Rp 0 (partnership negotiation)
- Year 2: Rp 50M (1 partnership, 10K merchants)
- Year 3: Rp 200M (2-3 partnerships, 30K merchants)

## Upgrade Path

**Dependencies:** Business development for POS partnerships
**Build Estimate:** 4-6 weeks (after partnership secured)
