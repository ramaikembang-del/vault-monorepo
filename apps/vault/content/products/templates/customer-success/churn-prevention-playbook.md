## Save Plan Framework

### Step 1: Diagnose (24 hours)

**Understand WHY they're at risk:**
- Review usage data
- Read support tickets
- Check last interactions
- Talk to account team

**Categorize the issue:**
- Product fit/gaps
- Lack of adoption
- Change in business (closed location, budget cuts)
- Competitive win
- Relationship issue

### Step 2: Emergency Call (48 hours)

**Reach out immediately:**
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [specific observation: low usage, support tickets, etc.].

I want to make sure PWBI is working for you. Can we jump on a quick call to discuss?

Tomorrow at [time]?
```

**On call:**
1. Listen (don't sell)
2. Acknowledge their concerns
3. Take ownership
4. Propose solution
5. Commit to timeline

### Step 3: Action Plan (1 week)

**Based on root cause:**

**If product gaps:**
- Show workarounds
- Commit to roadmap timeline if planned
- Offer beta/early access

**If lack of adoption:**
- Free training session
- Simplified setup
- Reduce complexity (fewer features, more focused)

**If budget:**
- Discount (10-20% for 3 months)
- Payment plan
- Downgrade to lower tier (keep them)

**If competitor:**
- Show differentiation
- Match critical features if possible
- Emphasize switching cost

### Step 4: Executive Involvement (if needed)

**Escalate to:**
- CS Manager: Yellow/moderate risk
- VP Customer Success: Red/high value
- CEO: Strategic account

### Step 5: Follow-Up (ongoing)

**Save plan implemented:**
- Weekly check-ins
- Track specific success metrics
- Adjust plan if not working
- Goal: Green health score in 30-60 days

## When to Let Go

**Sometimes churning is right:**
- Wrong product fit (we can't solve their problem)
- Unrealistic expectations
- Abusive behavior
- Not paying

**Graceful exit:**
- Help with offboarding
- Export their data
- Stay friendly (they might return)
- Learn from the loss
