## Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Last-Minute Call-Out**
1. Staff calls in sick
2. Manager opens app → sees shift needs coverage
3. Send notification to available staff ("Extra shift available")
4. First to accept → Gets shift

**Scenario 2: Shift Swap**
1. Staff A can't work Friday dinner
2. Offers shift to colleagues via app
3. Staff B accepts
4. Manager approves swap
5. Schedule updated, both notified

**Scenario 3: Overtime Prevention**
1. System detects Staff C approaching 40 hours
2. Alerts manager: "OT risk"
3. Manager adjusts schedule → assign shift to different staff
