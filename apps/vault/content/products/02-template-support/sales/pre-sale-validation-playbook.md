# Pre-Sale Validation Playbook - R1 Template Support

**Product:** R1 - Power BI Template Monthly Support
**Purpose:** Validate subscription demand BEFORE building support infrastructure
**Model:** Recurring revenue (Rp 75K/month) - Different from A1's one-time sale
**Timeline:** Week 0 (1-2 weeks validation) → Decision Gate → Build support systems

---

## Why Validate R1 Differently Than A1?

**A1 (Template) Validation:**
- One-time Rp 2-15M sale (high commitment)
- Validate: "Will you pay Rp 2M for a dashboard?"
- Success: 3-5 deposits = Rp 3-6M upfront

**R1 (Support) Validation:**
- Monthly Rp 75K subscription (low commitment, but need volume)
- Validate: "Will you pay Rp 75K/month for ongoing help?"
- Success: 10-15 verbal "yes" = Rp 750K-1.1M MRR committed

**Key Difference:** R1 needs MORE commitments but they're easier to get (lower price, lower risk).

---

## Week 0: Pre-Sale Validation Phase

### Goal: Get 10-15 Subscription Commitments

**Success Criteria:**
- **Minimum:** 10 verbal commitments ("Yes, I'd subscribe for Rp 75K/month")
- **Ideal:** 15 commitments (Rp 1.1M MRR potential)
- **Stretch:** 20 waitlist signups (indicates broader market)

**Why 10-15 vs A1's 3-5?**
- Lower barrier (Rp 75K vs Rp 2M)
- Recurring revenue needs volume to be meaningful
- 10 subscribers × Rp 75K = Rp 750K MRR (worthwhile to build)
- <5 subscribers = Not worth dedicated support infrastructure

---

## Step 1: Create Validation Assets (Day 1-2)

### A. One-Page Service Description

**Format:** Simple text doc or PDF (not as polished as A1)

**Content:**
```
R1: POWER BI TEMPLATE MONTHLY SUPPORT

Sudah beli template A1 tapi butuh bantuan terus-terusan?

ANDA DAPAT:
 Priority email support (<48h response vs 30-day only)
 Monthly template updates (new metrics, bug fixes)
 1x monthly Q&A call (30 min, kelompok 5-10 orang)
 Access to troubleshooting knowledge base
 WhatsApp grup support (eksklusif subscribers)

HARGA: Rp 75K/bulan
Cancel anytime (no contract, month-to-month)

MASUK AKAL?
Lebih murah dari 1x makan di luar (Rp 75K) untuk peace of mind.

Minat? Reply "YA" atau DM untuk early access (Rp 50K/bulan first 3 months).
```

### B. Early Access Offer

**Pricing:**
- **Standard:** Rp 75K/month (after launch)
- **Early Access:** Rp 50K/month for first 3 months (33% discount)

**Why discount?**
- Builds initial base (need 10-15 to start)
- They help validate service (give feedback on what's useful)
- Lock in MRR before launch

---

## Step 2: Target Market (Different from A1)

### Who to Validate With:

** BEST: A1 Template Buyers (if you have any)**
- They already bought template
- Natural upsell: "Need ongoing help?"
- Warm audience, high conversion

** GOOD: People who asked questions about A1**
- Showed interest but didn't buy (maybe too complex)
- "Instead of buying template, subscribe to support for setup + ongoing help"
- Position as "template rental with support"

** OK: F&B owners in communities**
- Same audience as A1
- Frame as: "Monthly Power BI support for your business"

---

## Step 3: Validation Conversations (Day 3-7)

**Target:** 20-30 conversations → 10-15 commitments (50% conversion)

### Script 1: For A1 Template Buyers

```
Hi [Name]! Quick follow-up on your A1 dashboard.

Gimana setup-nya? Ada kendala?

Kalau butuh ongoing support (buat update data, troubleshoot, add metrics),
aku lg trial program support bulanan: Rp 50K/bulan (first 3 months).

Include:
- Email support (<48h)
- Monthly updates
- 1x group Q&A call per month
- WhatsApp grup eksklusif

Worth it atau terlalu mahal?
```

**Expected:** 40-60% say "yes" (they already paid Rp 2M+, Rp 50K is cheap)

---

### Script 2: For People Who Didn't Buy A1

```
Hi [Name]! Dulu kamu tanya soal Power BI dashboard kan?

Aku punya opsi baru: Daripada beli template Rp 2M+,
subscribe support bulanan aja (Rp 50K/bulan).

Dapat:
- Bantuan setup dashboard (pake template aku atau bikin sendiri)
- Ongoing support
- Monthly Q&A call
- WhatsApp grup

Basically, "rent" akses ke template + support. No big upfront cost.

Minat?
```

**Expected:** 30-40% say "yes" (removes price barrier)

---

### Script 3: For F&B Community (Cold)

```
Teman-teman, ada yang udah pake Power BI buat track bisnis?

Aku tawarkan monthly support: Rp 75K/bulan.
- Email support (<48h response)
- Monthly template updates
- Group Q&A call (all subscribers)
- WhatsApp support grup

Target: Owner/manager yang udah punya dashboard Power BI (atau mau bikin)
tapi butuh bantuan rutinrutin.

Worth it? Or too niche?
```

**Expected:** 10-20% show interest

---

## Step 4: Track Validation Metrics

### Validation Scorecard

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Conversations | 20-30 | ___ | |
| Positive interest | 15 | ___ | |
| Verbal commitments | 10-15 | ___ | |
| Email signups (waitlist) | 20 | ___ | |

---

## Step 5: Decision Gate (End of Week 0)

### Scenario A: PROCEED if:
- 10+ verbal commitments OR
- 15+ waitlist signups OR
- 5+ confirmed pre-payments (Rp 50K × 3 months = Rp 150K each)

**Action:**
- Build support infrastructure (Zendesk/Notion help desk, WhatsApp grup, Calendly for calls)
- Set up monthly billing (Midtrans recurring)
- Launch to committed subscribers

**Expected MRR:** Rp 500K-1.1M (10-15 subscribers × Rp 50-75K)

---

### Scenario B: PAUSE if:
- <5 verbal commitments
- <10 waitlist signups
- People say "nanti aja" (not urgent)

**Action:**
- ⏸ Don't build support infrastructure yet
- Investigate:
 - Price too high? (Test Rp 50K permanently, not just promotion)
 - Value unclear? (What support do they ACTUALLY need?)
 - Not urgent? (Wait until more A1 sales exist)

**Pivot Options:**
1. **Bundle with A1:** "Buy template for Rp 2.5M, get 3 months support free (Rp 225K value)"
2. **Per-Incident Support:** "Rp 200K per support request" (no subscription)
3. **Delay R1 to Sprint 2:** Focus on A1 sales first, revisit when 20+ A1 customers exist

---

### Scenario C: MIXED SIGNALS if:
- 5-9 commitments (close but not quite)
- 10-14 waitlist (interest but no money)

**Action:**
- Extend validation 1 more week
- Offer stronger incentive: "Rp 50K/month PERMANENTLY for first 10 subscribers" (lock in low price)
- Re-evaluate end of Week 1

---

## Key Differences from A1 Validation

| Aspect | A1 (Template) | R1 (Support) |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Commitment Ask** | Rp 1M deposit (50%) | "Yes, I'll subscribe" (no money upfront) |
| **Target Commitments** | 3-5 | 10-15 |
| **Validation Difficulty** | Harder (big ask) | Easier (low commitment) |
| **Build Time if Validated** | 3-4 weeks | 1 week (support systems) |
| **Revenue Model** | One-time Rp 2-15M | Recurring Rp 750K-1.1M MRR |

---

## What to Build if Validated

**Week 1 (If validation succeeds):**
1. **Support Ticketing:** Zendesk free tier or Notion database
2. **WhatsApp Group:** Create subscriber-only grup
3. **Billing:** Set up Midtrans recurring payments (Rp 75K/month auto-charge)
4. **Monthly Call:** Calendly link for group Q&A (30 min, once per month)
5. **Knowledge Base:** Notion page with FAQs, troubleshooting guides

**Week 2: Launch to Committed Subscribers**
- Send onboarding email
- Add to WhatsApp grup
- Send first month invoice (Rp 50K early access)
- Schedule first Q&A call

---

## Success Metrics

### Month 1 (Post-Launch)
- 10-15 active subscribers
- Rp 500K-1.1M MRR
- <5% churn (1-2 cancel out of 15)
- Avg 5-10 support tickets per month (manageable)

### Month 3 (Validation of Retention)
- 80%+ retention (12/15 still subscribed)
- Rp 750K+ MRR (growing or stable)
- 2-3 new subscribers from referrals
- NPS >40 (subscribers happy with value)

**If these metrics hit:** R1 validated, continue.
**If <50% retention:** Reevaluate value prop, maybe pivot to per-incident support.

---

## Tools & Resources

**Validation Phase:**
- WhatsApp messages (primary outreach)
- Google Form for waitlist signup

---

## Next Steps After Validation
