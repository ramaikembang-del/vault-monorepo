## Objection Handling Playbook

### Objection 1: "I Can't Afford Rp 75K/Month"

**Response (Email):**
```
Hi [Name],

I understand budget is tight.

Let me share the math:

You paid [Rp 2M / 5M / 10M] for this template.

Without support:
- Year 1: Template breaks (POS update) = 4 hours troubleshooting = Rp 400K opportunity cost
- Year 2: Miss 8 new metrics = competitive disadvantage (hard to quantify, but real)
- Year 3: Template outdated = Rp 2M investment wasted

With support:
- Rp 75K × 12 = Rp 900K/year
- Template stays current forever
- **Break-even: 9 months** (vs. buying new template)

Still tight? We have Rp 50K/month option (not advertised, but available for tight budgets).

Reply if interested.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Objection 2: "I Don't Need Updates Yet"

**Response:**
```
Fair point! You just bought the template.

But here's the issue:

**POS systems don't ask permission before updating.**

Last year:
- Moka changed CSV format 3× (Feb, Jun, Nov)
- Pawoon changed column names 2× (Apr, Aug)
- Qasir updated date format 1× (Sep)

Each change = your template breaks.

non-subscribers emailed us: "Dashboard won't refresh, can you help?"
Our response: "That's what Template Support fixes. Subscribe or buy updated template (Rp 500K)."

**Subscribe now = insurance.** First month free, cancel anytime.

Worst case: You cancel after 1 month, paid Rp 0, got peace of mind.

### Objection 3: "I'll Just Re-Buy When I Need It"

**Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

That's one strategy! Let me show you the costs:

**Buy Updates As-Needed:**
- Major update (v1.0 → v2.0): Rp 500K each
- We release 3-4 major updates/year
- Year 1 cost: Rp 1.5-2M
- PLUS: No support between updates

**Subscribe:**
- Rp 75K/month × 12 = Rp 900K/year
- Includes ALL updates + support
- **Save Rp 600K-1.1M per year**

Also: Subscribers get early access to E1 Lite Dashboard (Rp 150K/month value, free for R1 subscribers).

Math is clear. But it's your call!

## Conversion Optimization Experiments

### Test A: Free Trial Duration

**Hypothesis:** 60-day trial converts better than 30-day

**Control:** "First Month Free" (30 days)
**Variant:** "First 2 Months Free" (60 days)

**Track:** Conversion rate, Month 3 churn

**Expected Result:** Higher conversion, but higher churn (less commitment)

---

### Test B: Pricing Anchor

**Hypothesis:** Showing consultant cost increases perceived value

**Control:** "Rp 75K/month for updates + support"
**Variant:** "Rp 75K/month (vs. Rp 500K per consultant call)"

**Track:** Click-through rate on CTA

---

### Test C: Urgency Framing

**Hypothesis:** Deadline increases conversion

**Control:** "First month free, cancel anytime"
**Variant:** "First month free - Offer ends Dec 31"

**Track:** Day 7 conversion rate

**Risk:** Feels pushy (may hurt brand trust)

---
