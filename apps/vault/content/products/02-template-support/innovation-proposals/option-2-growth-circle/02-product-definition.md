 - Primary goals (e.g., "reduce food cost", "open 2nd location", "hire manager")
 - Preferred communication style (weekly check-in, monthly deep-dive, async text)
 - Timezone/availability
2. **Algorithm matches** based on:
 - Similar goals (e.g., both want to reduce food cost)
 - Similar segment (e.g., both cafés in Jakarta)
 - Complementary strengths (e.g., one strong in marketing, other in operations)
3. **Intro facilitated** by community manager (3-way intro email/message)

**Ongoing: Monthly Check-Ins**
- **Commitment:** 15-30 min call (or async check-in) once per month
- **Agenda Template:**
 1. Review last month's goal: Did you hit it? Why/why not?
 2. Share this month's goal: What are you committing to?
 3. Accountability: How can I help you stay on track?
 4. Advice: Any challenges I can help with?

**Quarterly: Re-Matching (Optional)**
- If partnership not working, can request new match
- If working great, can continue indefinitely

**Success Tracking:**
- Members report: "Did you complete your monthly check-in?" (Yes/No)
