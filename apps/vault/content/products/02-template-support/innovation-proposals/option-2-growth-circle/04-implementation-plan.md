## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Can't recruit 30 founding members**
- **Mitigation:** Lower founding price to Rp 40K for first month
- **Fallback:** If <20 commits, delay launch and improve value prop

**Risk 2: Expert facilitators decline or perform poorly**
- **Mitigation:** Recruit 3-5 backup experts before launch
- **Quality control:** Member rating after each call (must be >4.0 to re-invite)

**Risk 3: Community engagement is low**
- **Mitigation:** Community manager seeds discussions daily
- **Tactics:** Weekly themed challenges, spotlight top contributors

**Risk 4: Churn is high (>20%)**
- **Mitigation:** Weekly check-ins with at-risk members
- **Exit survey:** Understand why leaving, iterate product
