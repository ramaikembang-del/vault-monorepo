# Option 2: Data-Driven Growth Circle
## Success Metrics & Validation Framework

**Product:** R1 Growth Circle
**Measurement Philosophy:** Engagement > Revenue (community health drives retention)
**Review Frequency:** Weekly (engagement), Monthly (revenue), Quarterly (strategic)

---

## North Star Metric

**Monthly Active Members (MAM) Rate:**
**"% of paying members who engaged meaningfully in past 30 days"**

**Engagement Definition:**
- Posted or commented in community (1+ times)
- OR Attended coaching call (live or watched recording)
- OR Completed accountability partnership check-in

**Target:** >70% MAM rate
**Rationale:** High engagement = high retention = sustainable business

**How to Measure:**
1. Track all member actions (posts, comments, call attendance, check-ins)
2. Flag members as "active" if any action in past 30 days
3. Calculate: (Active Members / Total Paying Members) × 100%

**Success Thresholds:**
- **Excellent:** >80% MAM (viral community, very sticky)
- **Good:** 60-80% MAM (healthy engagement)
- **Acceptable:** 40-60% MAM (average community)
- **Poor:** <40% MAM (high churn risk)

- **Red Flag:** >30% churn = fundamental product issue

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**

- **Calculation:** (Start MRR - Churn + Upgrades - Downgrades) / Start MRR

**Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**
- **Target:**
 - Year 1: Rp 97.5K (70% basic, 30% premium)
 - Year 2: Rp 100K (more premium upgrades)
