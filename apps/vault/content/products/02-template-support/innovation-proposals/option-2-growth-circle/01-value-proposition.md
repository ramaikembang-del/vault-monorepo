## Customer Testimonial Vision (Aspirational)

> "I joined R1 Growth Circle feeling totally lost - my food cost was 32% and I didn't know if that was normal or terrible. Within the first week, I saw in the benchmarking dashboard: I'm bottom 10%. Immediately asked the community 'How are top performers hitting 24%?' Got 8 detailed responses. Tried 3 tactics, now at 27% (saving Rp 1.5M/month). But honestly, the biggest value is just feeling less alone. When I'm stressed at 2am about payroll, I can post in the group and 5 people respond within an hour. Worth way more than Rp 75K."
