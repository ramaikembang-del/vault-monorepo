## Overview

**What is it?**
A membership community where FnB owners using the A1 Power BI Template learn from each other's data, supported by expert facilitators. Think: **Mastermind group + business coaching + peer benchmarking**.

**Why it works:**
- **Peer learning is free** (customers teach each other)
- **Group leverage** (1 expert serves 20-50 members)
- **Network effects** (more members = more value)
- **Lower cost than 1-on-1** (Rp 75K vs. Rp 300K+)

**Inspiration:**
- **YPO/EO** (entrepreneurs' peer groups) - but for FnB SMEs
- **Indie Hackers** (community + revenue transparency)
- **SaaStr Community** (SaaS founders help each other)
