 WEEKLY INSIGHTS - [Restaurant Name]
Week of [Date]

 Hi [Owner Name],

I reviewed your data from last week. Here's what stood out:

 TOP 3 OPPORTUNITIES THIS WEEK:

1. **PRICING OPPORTUNITY - Nasi Goreng (+Rp 1.2M/month)**
 - Current price: Rp 35,000
 - Market data: 3 competitors raised to Rp 40,000 this month
 - Your volume: 240 orders/month
 - Action: Test Rp 40,000 price this week
 - Expected gain: 240 × Rp 5,000 = Rp 1.2M/month
 - Risk: Low (still competitive)

2. **WASTE REDUCTION - Chicken inventory (-Rp 600K/month)**
 - Data: 15% waste rate on chicken (vs. 8% optimal)
 - Root cause: Over-ordering on Mondays
 - Action: Reduce Monday chicken order from 10kg → 7kg
 - Expected savings: 3kg × 4 weeks × Rp 50K = Rp 600K/month
 - Risk: Low (adjust if sellout occurs)

3. **LABOR OPTIMIZATION - Monday afternoon shift (-Rp 400K/month)**
 - Data: 2-4pm Monday traffic is 60% below Tuesday-Thursday
 - Current: 3 staff scheduled
 - Action: Reduce to 2 staff on Monday 2-4pm slot
 - Expected savings: 4 shifts/month × Rp 100K = Rp 400K/month
 - Risk: Low (can call backup if needed)

 RED FLAG TO WATCH THIS WEEK:

Food cost trending up (27% → 28% → 29% last 3 weeks)
 - If it hits 30% by week-end, we need to investigate supplier pricing
 - I'll send alert if this happens

 LAST WEEK'S WINS:

 Labor cost improved to 24% (down from 26% - great job!)
 Weekend sales up 8% vs. previous weekend

Metric: Food Cost
Change: 24% → 29% (+5 points)

 LIKELY ROOT CAUSE:

### 3. Monthly Performance Review (Voice Note)

**Frequency:** First Monday of every month
**Delivery:** WhatsApp voice message
**Length:** 2-3 minutes
**Analyst Time:** 15-20 min (review + recording)

**Voice Note Script Structure:**

```
[INTRO - 10 seconds]
"Hi [Owner], it's [Analyst] from R1. Quick review of your December performance..."

[PERFORMANCE SUMMARY - 45 seconds]
"Overall: solid month. Revenue up 8%, profit margin improved from 12% to 14%.
The labor cost optimization we tried worked - you saved Rp 1.6M by adjusting shifts.

Three highlights:
1. Food cost finally under control - 25% all month (was 28% in November)
2. Weekend sales are crushing it - up 15%
3. New menu items performing well - Rp 400K extra revenue

One concern: Weekday lunch traffic still soft, down 5% vs. November."

[GOAL REVIEW - 30 seconds]
"We set 3 goals last month:
1. Food cost under 26% - ACHIEVED (hit 25%)
2. Launch 2 new menu items - ACHIEVED
3. Increase weekday lunch revenue 10% - MISSED (only +2%)

Great execution on 2 out of 3."

[NEXT MONTH GOALS - 30 seconds]
"For January, I recommend:
1. Focus on weekday lunch - try Rp 30K 'express lunch' promotion
2. Reduce food waste from 8% to 6% (Rp 500K/month savings)
3. Test Rp 5K price increase on top 5 dishes

I'll send detailed plan in Monday's report."

[CLOSE - 15 seconds]
"Congrats on a strong December. Let me know if you want to discuss any of this. Talk soon!"
```

**Recording Process:**
1. Analyst reviews full month's data (15 min)
2. Records voice note (3 min)
3. Sends via WhatsApp (1-click)
4. Customer listens during commute/break

**Why Voice, Not Text:**
- Personal connection (build relationship)
- Faster to consume (listen while driving)
- Human touch (not robotic)
- Accountability (harder to ignore a person)

### 5. Priority Support (Async Q&A)

**Channels:**
- WhatsApp Business (primary)
- Email (secondary)

**Response SLA:**
- Standard: <24 hours weekdays, <48 hours weekends
- Urgent: <4 hours (marked with "URGENT:" prefix)

**Scope:**

** Included Questions:**
- "Why did X metric change?" (data interpretation)
- "How do I improve Y?" (strategy advice)
- "What does this number mean?" (context)
- "Should I do X or Y?" (decision support)
- "Can you analyze Z for me?" (ad-hoc analysis, 1 per month)

** Not Included:**
- Technical troubleshooting ("Power BI won't open") → Escalate to tech support
- Accounting/tax questions → Refer to accountant
- Legal questions → Refer to legal counsel
- Custom dashboard requests → Upgrade to Premium tier

**Typical Q&A Examples:**

*Customer:* "Why did my revenue drop 12% last week?"
*Analyst (< 2 hours):* "I pulled your data. Two reasons: (1) You were closed Sunday for renovation = -15% from missing day, (2) Rainy weather Tue-Thu = -8% foot traffic. Looks temporary, not structural. Should bounce back this week."

*Customer:* "Should I add pizza to my menu?"
*Analyst (<24 hours):* "Based on your data: (1) Your kitchen can handle it (current capacity 70%), (2) Your customer base skews 25-35yo who love pizza, (3) BUT your average ticket is Rp 45K and pizza requires Rp 60K+ pricing. Risk: might alienate price-sensitive regulars. Recommend: Test 1-2 pizza SKUs as 'premium' options first, see uptake before full menu."
