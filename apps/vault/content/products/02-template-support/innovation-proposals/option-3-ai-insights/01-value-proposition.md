## Customer Testimonial Vision (Aspirational)

> "I used to spend 2-3 hours every Sunday analyzing my Power BI dashboard, trying to figure out what was wrong. Now the AI Insights tab just tells me: 'Your top 3 priorities this week.' Last month it recommended I switch chicken suppliers - saved Rp 1.5M. The month before, it caught a cash flow issue 6 weeks early so I could adjust inventory orders. It's like having a data scientist on payroll for Rp 300K. I'll never go back to manual analysis."
