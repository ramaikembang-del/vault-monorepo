# R1 Product Innovation Proposals
## From "Template Support" to "Business Transformation Through Data Clarity"

**Created:** January 4, 2026
**Status:** Strategic Proposals for Decision
**Purpose:** Define what R1 (Template Support & Subscription) should actually be

---

## The Problem

**Current R1 is weak.** It's just template updates + reactive support bundled as a subscription (Rp 75K/month). This doesn't solve the real customer pain:

> **"I have data but no idea what it means or what to do about it."**

Customers don't need software maintenance. They need **business transformation through data clarity**.

---

## Three Innovation Paths

We've developed 3 comprehensive proposals that fundamentally rethink what R1 should be:

### Option 1: Fractional Analytics Officer
**"Your part-time data analyst, full-time business advisor"**

- **What:** Human-powered insights-as-a-service
- **Deliver:** Weekly WhatsApp insights, anomaly alerts, monthly coaching
- **Price:** Rp 300K/month
- **Best For:** High-touch, personalized business advisory
- **Time to Market:** 3 months
- **Scalability:** Medium (20-25 customers per analyst)
- ****

---

### Option 2: Data-Driven Growth Circle
**"Learn from peers who've solved your exact problems"**

- **What:** Peer learning community + expert group coaching
- **Deliver:** Private community, monthly coaching calls, peer benchmarking
- **Price:** Rp 75-150K/month

## Recommended Approach: Phased Hybrid Strategy

Don't choose one - build all three sequentially:

### Phase 1 (Month 1-6): Launch Growth Circle START HERE

**Why:** Fastest to market, lowest risk, generates immediate cash flow

**What to Build:**
- WhatsApp/Circle community
- Monthly expert-led coaching calls
- Peer benchmarking dashboard

**Targets:**
- 100 members @ Rp 75K = Rp 7.5M MRR
- Break-even by Month 6
- >80% retention

**Investment:** Rp 25M

---

### Phase 2 (Month 7-12): Add Premium Tier with Human Insights

**Why:** Upsell top 20%, learn what great insights look like, prepare for AI

**What to Add:**
- 1-on-1 analyst insights (for premium members)
- Automated data pipeline
- Analyst playbook (becomes AI training data)

**Targets:**
- 150 total members (120 basic, 30 premium)
- Rp 18M MRR
- Test human insight automation

**Investment:** +Rp 50M

---

### Phase 3 (Month 13-24): Build AI Insights Layer

**Why:** Use learnings from Phases 1-2 to build AI that actually works

**What to Build:**
- AI "Insights" tab in Power BI template
- GPT-4 integration for recommendations
- Predictive analytics engine

**Targets:**
- 500 total customers
- Rp 75M MRR
- 85% gross margin (software economics)

**Investment:** +Rp 300M

---

## Why This Phased Approach Works

1. **De-risks AI investment** - Learn what customers actually want before spending Rp 300M on AI
2. **Generates cash flow** - Phase 1 breaks even by Month 6, funds Phase 2-3
3. **Builds moat progressively** - Community (Phase 1) → Human expertise (Phase 2) → Proprietary AI (Phase 3)
4. **Tests market demand** - If Phase 1 fails, we haven't wasted 12 months building AI
5. **Creates training data** - Community questions + analyst insights = AI training dataset

---

## Financial Projections (3-Year Phased Approach)

### Year 1: Community Foundation
- **Customers:** 150 (100 basic @ Rp 75K, 50 premium @ Rp 300K)
- **MRR:** Rp 22.5M

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week):

2. **Decide:** Which approach to pursue (recommended: Phased Hybrid)
3. **Validate:** Survey 20 A1 customers on willingness to pay for chosen option

### If Choosing Phase 1 (Growth Circle):
1. **Pre-sell:** Get 20+ commitments before building
2. **Hire:** Community manager + expert facilitator
3. **Build:** 2-week sprint (WhatsApp group + Zoom setup)
4. **Launch:** Week 3 (first monthly coaching call)

### If Choosing Phased Hybrid:
1. **Execute Phase 1** (Month 1-6: Growth Circle)
2. **Evaluate at Month 6:** Did we hit targets? (100 members, 80% retention, break-even)
3. **If YES → Proceed to Phase 2** (add human insights tier)
4. **If NO → Iterate or pivot**

## Key Insights

**What We Learned:**

1. **Current R1 is not a product** - It's just maintenance bundled as a subscription
2. **Real customer pain is interpretation, not data** - They have dashboards, they don't know what to do
3. **Community is fastest/cheapest win** - Option 2 gets us to market in 2 months with Rp 25M
4. **AI is the long-term vision** - Option 3 has infinite scale, but requires 12-18 months
5. **Phased approach de-risks** - Build community first, learn, then invest in AI

**Strategic Recommendation:**

Don't pick one option. **Build all three sequentially.** Start with community (fast win), layer in human insights (premium tier), build toward AI (infinite scale). This creates a tiered product suite that serves different customer segments while progressively building toward the most defensible, scalable version.
