## R1-Specific Legal Considerations

- Auto-renewal unless customer cancels
- No long-term contract commitment (cancel anytime)

**Support Scope:**

- 48-hour response SLA (business days)
- Covers template updates and Q&A, NOT custom development

**Cancellation:**
- Customer may cancel anytime
- Effective at end of current billing period
- No partial refunds (monthly subscription model)

**Intellectual Property:**
- Template updates remain Provider IP
- Customer retains rights to their business data
- Support communications may be used for knowledge base (anonymized)
