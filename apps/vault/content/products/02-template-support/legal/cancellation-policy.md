## 2. Refund Policy

### 2.1 Monthly Subscription Refunds

**Policy:** [x] **NO REFUNDS** for monthly subscriptions

**Rationale:**
- Monthly subscriptions are low-commitment, cancel anytime
- You retain access until end of paid month (pro-rated in time, not money)
- Administrative cost of processing refunds exceeds value (Rp 75,000)

**Example:**
- Subscribed January 1, paid Rp 75,000 for January
- Cancelled January 20
- Access until January 31 (11 days remaining)
- No refund issued

**Exception:** See Section 2.4 (Extraordinary Circumstances)

### 2.2 Annual Subscription Refunds

**Policy:** [x] **Pro-rated refund if cancelled within first 6 months**

**Calculation:**
```
Refund Amount = (Remaining Months / 12) Ã— Rp 750,000
```

**Examples:**

| Subscription Start | Cancellation Date | Months Used | Months Remaining | Refund Amount |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| Jan 1, 2025 | Feb 15, 2025 | 1.5 | 10.5 | Rp 656,250 |
| Jan 1, 2025 | Apr 1, 2025 | 3 | 9 | Rp 562,500 |
| Jan 1, 2025 | Jun 30, 2025 | 6 | 6 | Rp 375,000 |
| Jan 1, 2025 | Jul 1, 2025 | 6+ | - | Rp 0 (no refund) |

**Why 6 Months Cutoff?**
- Balances fairness to customer vs business sustainability
- Annual plan offers 17% discount (2 months free) - committed pricing
- 6 months = reasonable trial period for annual commitment

## 4. Pause vs Cancel
