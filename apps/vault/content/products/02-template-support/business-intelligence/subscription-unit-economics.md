**Monthly Plan:**
- Base Price: Rp 75,000/month
- PPN (11% VAT): Rp 8,250
- **Total Price (incl tax):** Rp 83,250/month
- **Revenue Recognition:** Rp 75,000 (excl VAT, recognized monthly)

**Annual Plan:**
- Base Price: Rp 750,000/year (Rp 62,500/month equivalent)
- PPN (11% VAT): Rp 82,500

- **Net New Subscribers:** 17
- **Exit MRR (Dec):** Rp 1,275,000
- **Annual Revenue:** Rp 11,025,000 (~Rp 11M)
- **Average Active Subscribers:** 11.8

**Note:** Assumes 70/30 monthly/annual mix. Annual subscribers contribute Rp 62,500/month to MRR.

---

**Assumptions:**
- A1 Template sales: 400 (Year 2), 650 (Year 3)
- Conversion rate: 30% (maintains from Year 1)
- Monthly churn: 10% (stabilized, mature subscribers)
- Annual plan mix: 50% (increased from Year 1's 30%)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A1 Template Sales** | 150 | 400 | 650 |
| **R1 Conversion Rate** | 30% | 30% | 30% |
| **New R1 Subscribers** | 34 | 75 | 120 |
| **Cumulative Subscribers** | 34 | 109 | 229 |

## 2. Cost Structure

### 2.1 Variable Costs (Per Subscriber)

**Direct Costs (Per Subscriber Per Month):**

| Cost Category | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **Support Time** | Rp 10,000 | Rp 120,000 | 1-2 support tickets/month @ Rp 5-15K labor cost |
| **Infrastructure** | Rp 2,000 | Rp 24,000 | Google Drive storage, email (Rp 50/GB, ~40GB/year) |
| **Payment Processing** | Rp 1,500 | Rp 18,000 | 2% Midtrans fee (Rp 75K × 2% = Rp 1,500) |
| **Template Updates (Allocated)** | Rp 0 | Rp 0 | Fixed cost, not marginal (see Section 2.2) |
| **TOTAL Variable Cost** | **Rp 13,500** | **Rp 162,000** | **Per subscriber** |

**Gross Margin:**
```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - Variable Cost) / Revenue
 = (Rp 75,000 - Rp 13,500) / Rp 75,000
 = 82%
```

**Contribution Margin (Per Subscriber):**
```
Contribution Margin = Revenue - Variable Cost
 = Rp 75,000 - Rp 13,500
 = Rp 61,500/month
```

---

### 2.2 Fixed Costs (Monthly)

**Overhead Costs (NOT Per Subscriber):**

| Cost Category | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **Support Staff (0.5 FTE)** | Rp 2,500,000 | Rp 30,000,000 | Part-time support person (Rp 5M salary × 50% allocation) |
| **Template Update Development** | Rp 1,500,000 | Rp 18,000,000 | 20 hours/month @ Rp 75K/hour (developer time) |
| **Tools & Software** | Rp 300,000 | Rp 3,600,000 | WhatsApp Business, email, Google Workspace, Midtrans fees |
| **Marketing (Upsell Campaigns)** | Rp 500,000 | Rp 6,000,000 | Email campaigns, win-back offers, content creation |
| **TOTAL Fixed Costs** | **Rp 4,800,000** | **Rp 57,600,000** | **Regardless of subscriber count** |

**Breakeven Analysis:**
```
Breakeven Subscribers = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin per Subscriber
 = Rp 4,800,000 / Rp 61,500
 = 7.8 ≈ 8 subscribers
```

**Profitability:**
- **8 subscribers:** Breakeven (Rp 0 profit)
- **11 subscribers:** Rp 676,500 monthly profit (target for Year 1 Months 4-6)
- **17 subscribers:** Rp 1,045,500 monthly profit (Year 1 exit target)
- **50 subscribers:** Rp 3,075,000 monthly profit (Year 2 Q2 target)

---

### 2.3 Total Cost Per Subscriber (Fully Loaded)

**At Different Subscriber Counts:**

| Active Subscribers | Fixed Cost Allocation | Variable Cost | Total Cost per Sub | Gross Margin % |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **5** | Rp 960,000 | Rp 13,500 | Rp 973,500 | -1,198% (LOSS) |
| **8** (Breakeven) | Rp 600,000 | Rp 13,500 | Rp 613,500 | -718% (Breakeven) |
| **11** | Rp 436,364 | Rp 13,500 | Rp 449,864 | -500% |
| **17** (Y1 Target) | Rp 282,353 | Rp 13,500 | Rp 295,853 | -294% |
| **50** | Rp 96,000 | Rp 13,500 | Rp 109,500 | -46% |
| **100** | Rp 48,000 | Rp 13,500 | Rp 61,500 | 18% |
| **200** | Rp 24,000 | Rp 13,500 | Rp 37,500 | 50% |

**Key Insight:** Fixed costs dominate at low subscriber counts (<20). At scale (100+), margins approach 82% (variable cost only).

---

## 3. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

### 3.1 Upsell CAC (Primary Channel)

**Scenario:** Upselling R1 to existing A1 buyers (30% conversion)

**Cost per A1 Customer to Acquire R1 Subscriber:**

| Activity | Cost per A1 Customer | Conversion Rate | Effective CAC |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Post-Purchase Email (Automated)** | Rp 0 | 10% | Rp 0 |
| **Day 7 Follow-Up Email** | Rp 2,500 | +10% | Rp 12,500 |
| **Day 30 Phone/WhatsApp Call** | Rp 10,000 | +10% | Rp 33,333 |
| **"First Month Free" Promo Cost** | Rp 75,000 | - | Rp 25,000 |
| **TOTAL** | - | **30%** | **Rp 22,500** |

**Calculation:**
```
Effective CAC = (Total Marketing Spend per A1 Customer) / Conversion Rate
 = (Rp 2,500 + Rp 10,000 + Rp 75,000/3) / 30%
 = Rp 37,500 / 30%
 = Rp 22,500
```

**Note:** "First month free" promo offered to 33% of A1 buyers (most aggressive segment), so cost is Rp 75,000 / 3 = Rp 25,000 average.

---

### 3.2 Cold Acquisition CAC (Future Channel)

**Scenario:** Acquiring R1 subscribers who didn't buy A1 first (NOT Sprint 1 strategy)

**Estimated CAC (Benchmark from SaaS Industry):**
- Facebook/Google Ads: Rp 50,000 - 150,000 per lead
- Conversion rate: 5-10% (without A1 template trust)
- **Estimated CAC: Rp 500,000 - Rp 1,500,000** (10-20x higher than upsell CAC)

**Conclusion:** Cold acquisition not viable at Rp 75K/month pricing. Must maintain upsell-only model.

---

## 4. Lifetime Value (LTV)

### 4.1 LTV Calculation

**Formula:**
```
LTV = (Average Revenue per Month) × (1 / Monthly Churn Rate)
```

**Year 1 LTV (High Churn):**
```
LTV = Rp 75,000 × (1 / 0.20)
 = Rp 75,000 × 5 months
 = Rp 375,000
```

**Year 2+ LTV (Stabilized Churn):**
```
LTV = Rp 75,000 × (1 / 0.10)
 = Rp 75,000 × 10 months
 = Rp 750,000
```

**Target LTV (Blended 15% Churn):**
```
LTV = Rp 75,000 × (1 / 0.15)
 = Rp 75,000 × 6.67 months
 = Rp 500,000
```

---

### 4.2 LTV by Cohort

**Cohort Retention Analysis:**

| Cohort | Month 1 | Month 3 | Month 6 | Month 12 | Avg Lifetime (Months) | LTV |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------------------|-----|
| **Year 1 Early (Jan-Mar)** | 100% | 60% | 40% | 25% | 5 months | Rp 375,000 |
| **Year 1 Late (Oct-Dec)** | 100% | 70% | 55% | 40% | 7 months | Rp 525,000 |
| **Year 2+ (Mature)** | 100% | 85% | 75% | 60% | 10 months | Rp 750,000 |

**Key Insight:** Later cohorts retain better (product improvements + social proof). Target 10-month avg lifetime by Year 2.

---

### 4.3 LTV/CAC Ratio

**Year 1:**
```
LTV/CAC = Rp 375,000 / Rp 22,500
 = 16.7x
```

**Year 2+ (Stabilized):**
```
LTV/CAC = Rp 750,000 / Rp 22,500
 = 33.3x
```

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- **Good:** 3x LTV/CAC
- **Great:** 5x LTV/CAC
- **Exceptional:** 10x+ LTV/CAC

**Assessment:** **R1 is EXCEPTIONAL** (16-33x LTV/CAC)

**Why So High?**
- Upsell model = ultra-low CAC (Rp 22.5K vs industry avg Rp 500K-1M)
- Existing trust from A1 purchase (high conversion rate)
- Monthly recurring revenue compounds LTV

---

### 4.4 Payback Period

**Formula:**
```
Payback Period = CAC / Monthly Contribution Margin
 = Rp 22,500 / Rp 61,500
 = 0.37 months (~11 days)
```

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- **Good:** <12 months
- **Great:** <6 months
- **Exceptional:** <3 months

**Assessment:** **R1 recovers CAC in <2 weeks** (exceptional)

| **Annual Profit** | **(Rp 49.2M)** LOSS | **(Rp 28.1M)** LOSS | **Rp 29.2M** PROFIT |
| Breakeven Month | Month 15 | - | - |

**Conclusion:** Current scenario breaks even Month 15, profitable by Year 3. Viable with patience.

---

### 5.3 Aggressive Scenario (40% Conversion, 15% Churn)

**Assumptions:**
- A1 sales: 150 / 400 / 650 (same)
- R1 conversion: 40% (high value perception + strong upsell)
- Monthly churn: 15% Year 1, 8% Year 2+ (excellent retention)
- Annual plan mix: 40% Year 1, 60% Year 2+ (trust established)

**Results:**

## 6. Sensitivity Analysis

### 6.1 Most Impactful Variables (Ranked)

**Impact on Year 3 Profit:**

| Variable | Baseline | +10% Change | Year 3 Profit Impact | Rank |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------------|------|
| **Conversion Rate** | 30% | 33% (+10%) | +Rp 36.5M (+125%) | #1 |
| **Monthly Churn** | 20% → 10% | 18% → 9% (-10%) | +Rp 28.7M (+98%) | #2 |
| **Subscription Price** | Rp 75K | Rp 82.5K (+10%) | +Rp 10.9M (+37%) | #3 |
| **A1 Template Sales** | 650 | 715 (+10%) | +Rp 3.3M (+11%) | #4 |
| **Annual Plan Mix** | 50% | 55% (+10%) | +Rp 2.1M (+7%) | #5 |

**Key Insights:**
- **Conversion rate** is 3x more impactful than pricing (focus on upsell, not price increases)
- **Churn reduction** is 3x more impactful than A1 sales growth (retention > acquisition)
- Pricing is relatively low-impact (Rp 75K is sticky, don't over-optimize)

---

### 6.2 Churn Sensitivity (Year 3 Active Subscribers)

| Monthly Churn Rate | Active Subs (Year 3) | Exit MRR | Annual Revenue | Annual Profit |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **10%** (Best Case) | 220 | Rp 16.5M | Rp 132.0M | Rp 51.7M |
| **15%** (Good) | 183 | Rp 13.0M | Rp 109.5M | Rp 29.2M |
| **20%** (Baseline) | 150 | Rp 11.3M | Rp 90.0M | Rp 9.7M |
| **25%** (Poor) | 122 | Rp 9.2M | Rp 73.2M | **(Rp 7.1M)** LOSS |
| **30%** (Unacceptable) | 98 | Rp 7.4M | Rp 58.8M | **(Rp 21.5M)** LOSS |

**Churn Target:** <15% monthly to ensure profitability by Year 3

---

### 6.3 Pricing Sensitivity (Year 3 Revenue)

| Monthly Price | Active Subs (Year 3) | Exit MRR | Annual Revenue | Annual Profit | Conversion Impact |
|--------------|----------------------|----------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Rp 50K** | 210 (+15%) | Rp 10.5M | Rp 84.0M | Rp 3.7M | Higher conversion (35%) |
| **Rp 65K** | 195 (+7%) | Rp 12.7M | Rp 101.4M | Rp 21.1M | Slightly higher (32%) |
| **Rp 75K** (Current) | 183 | Rp 13.0M | Rp 109.5M | Rp 29.2M | Baseline (30%) |
| **Rp 85K** | 165 (-10%) | Rp 14.0M | Rp 112.2M | Rp 31.9M | Lower conversion (27%) |
| **Rp 100K** | 140 (-23%) | Rp 14.0M | Rp 112.0M | Rp 31.7M | Much lower (24%) |

**Optimal Price:** Rp 75-85K (current pricing is near-optimal)

**Why Not Increase to Rp 100K?**
- Conversion drops 23% (from 30% to 24%)
- Revenue only increases 2% (not worth conversion loss)
- Psychological barrier at Rp 100K+ (SME budget threshold)

---

## 8. Strategic Recommendations

### 8.1 Pricing Strategy

**Current Pricing (Rp 75K) is Optimal:** Keep unchanged for Year 1

**Do NOT:**
- Lower to Rp 50K (leaves money on table, only +15% conversion)
- Increase to Rp 100K+ (psychological barrier, -23% conversion)

**DO Consider:**
- Rp 85K in Year 2 (5% price increase after value proven, minimal conversion impact)
- Rp 750K annual (current offering, push harder on annual plan mix)
- "First 2 months free" promo instead of "first month free" (increases LTV by locking in longer)

---

### 8.2 Retention Focus

**Priority #1:** Reduce churn from 20% to <15% by Month 6

**Tactics:**
1. **Month 1 Engagement:** Welcome call + 3 onboarding emails (reduce early churn)
2. **Month 3 Check-In:** "Are you getting value?" survey + offer help (catch at-risk subscribers)
3. **Month 6 Win-Back:** If subscriber hasn't used support in 3 months, proactive outreach
4. **Quarterly Value Reminder:** "You've saved Rp [X] this quarter" email (ROI proof)

**Target Impact:** 20% → 15% churn = +Rp 20M profit by Year 3

---

### 8.3 Upsell Optimization

**Priority #2:** Increase conversion from 30% to 35%

**Tactics:**
1. **A1 Purchase Email:** Add ROI calculator showing "Rp 75K/month = 1 support question" value
2. **Day 7 Follow-Up:** Share case study (testimonial from early subscriber)
3. **Day 30 Call:** Personal touch from founder for high-value A1 buyers (Tier 3)
4. **"First Month Free" Offer:** Extend to all A1 buyers (currently only 33%), absorb Rp 75K cost

**Target Impact:** 30% → 35% conversion = +Rp 18M profit by Year 3

---

### 8.4 Cost Optimization

**DO NOT cut:**
- Support quality (drives churn)
- Template updates (core value prop)

**DO optimize:**
- Automate FAQ responses (reduce support time from 2 hours → 1 hour per subscriber)
- Build knowledge base (self-service reduces tickets by 30%)
- Template update efficiency (standardize release process, reduce from 20 hours → 15 hours per update)

**Target Impact:** -Rp 1.2M monthly fixed costs by Year 2 (knowledge base + automation)

---

## 9. Validation Checklist
