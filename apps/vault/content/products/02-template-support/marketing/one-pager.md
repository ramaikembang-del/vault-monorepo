## Never Let Your Analytics Fall Behind

### The Problem

You invested Rp 200,000 in the Power BI Template for F&B Analytics. It works great today.

**But what happens when:**
- Your POS system updates its export format (and the template breaks)?
- Power BI releases a new version (and your template becomes incompatible)?
- You discover a bug or need help troubleshooting a data issue?
- New metrics become industry-standard (and your competitors are using them)?

**Without ongoing support, your Rp 200K template becomes outdated in 6-12 months.**

You'll either pay Rp 2-5M to rebuild it... or go back to manual Excel reporting.

---

## The Solution: Template Support & Subscription

**Never worry about outdated analytics again.**

For just **Rp 75,000/month**, you get:

### **1. Monthly Template Updates**
- **New metrics** as industry standards evolve (e.g., labor cost %, inventory turnover)
- **Bug fixes** within 24-48 hours of discovery
- **POS compatibility updates** when your POS system changes formats
- **Performance improvements** (faster data refresh, better visuals)
- **Power BI version updates** (stay compatible with latest Power BI releases)

**Value:** Avoid Rp 2-5M template rebuild every 2 years = **Rp 2M+ saved**

---

### **2. Priority Support (<24 Hours)**
- **Email support** with <24-hour response time (weekdays)
- **WhatsApp support** for urgent issues (Mon-Sat, 9 AM - 6 PM WIB)
- **Troubleshooting** data refresh errors, POS import issues, calculation bugs
- **Best practices** for F&B analytics (benchmarking, KPI selection, dashboards)

**Compare to alternatives:**
- **Freelance consultant:** Rp 500K-1M per hour (1 question = 1-2 hours = Rp 500K-2M)
- **Free forums:** 3-7 day response time, generic answers (not specific to your template)

**Value:** 2-3 support questions/year = **Rp 1-6M saved**

---

### **3. Early Access to New Features**
- **Beta testing** new dashboard pages before public release
- **Feature voting** (influence what gets built next)
- **Product roadmap visibility** (plan ahead for new capabilities)

**Example upcoming features (2025):**
- Inventory optimization module
- Labor scheduling dashboard
- Multi-location comparison (franchise mode)

**Value:** Get competitive advantage **6-12 months earlier** than non-subscribers

---

### **4. Learning Resources**
- **Monthly tips & tutorials** (email newsletter)
- **Industry benchmarks** (compare your metrics to similar restaurants)
- **Case studies** (how other restaurants use the template to improve profitability)

**Value:** Learn best practices **without hiring a Rp 10M/year consultant**

- **Annual:** Rp 750,000/year

### **What You Save:**

| Benefit | Without Subscription | With Subscription | Savings |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|---------|
| **Template Rebuild** (every 2 years) | Rp 2,000,000 | Rp 0 (free updates) | **Rp 2,000,000** |
| **Support Questions** (3/year @ Rp 500K/hour) | Rp 1,500,000 | Rp 0 (free support) | **Rp 1,500,000** |
| **Bug Fixes** (1/year @ Rp 1M) | Rp 1,000,000 | Rp 0 (free fixes) | **Rp 1,000,000** |
| **Total Savings (2 years)** | Rp 4,500,000 | Rp 1,500,000 | **Rp 3,000,000** |

**ROI Calculation:**
```
2-Year ROI = (Savings - Cost) / Cost
 = (Rp 4,500,000 - Rp 1,500,000) / Rp 1,500,000
 = 200% ROI (3x return on investment)
```

**Bottom Line:** For every Rp 1 you spend on the subscription, you save Rp 3 in consultant fees, rebuild costs, and downtime.

## Who Should Subscribe?

### **You SHOULD Subscribe If:**
- You rely on the template for weekly/monthly business decisions
- You update your dashboard at least once per month
- You want peace of mind (no surprises when POS or Power BI updates)
- You value your time (Rp 500K/hour opportunity cost for troubleshooting)

### **You MIGHT NOT Need It If:**
- You only check your dashboard once every 3-6 months
- You have an in-house data analyst who can fix issues
- You're comfortable troubleshooting technical issues yourself
- Your POS system and Power BI version never change (unlikely!)

**Honest Recommendation:** If you use the template actively (monthly+), the subscription pays for itself within 3-6 months.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I don't use support much?**
A: Updates alone are worth it. Avoiding a Rp 2M template rebuild every 2 years = Rp 83K/month savings. Even without support, you break even.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: **Yes.** Monthly plan: cancel with 7-day notice, no penalty. Annual plan: pro-rated refund if cancelled within 6 months.

**Q: What if the template breaks and you can't fix it?**
A: We guarantee <24-hour response for critical issues (template won't open, data won't refresh). If we can't fix it within 7 days, you get a full refund for that month.

**Q: Do I get updates forever if I cancel?**
A: No. You keep the **last version you downloaded** (forever), but no future updates. You can re-subscribe anytime to get new updates.

**Q: Can I switch from Monthly to Annual later?**
A: Yes! We'll credit your monthly payments toward the annual subscription. (Example: Paid 3 months = Rp 225K credit toward Rp 750K annual plan.)

**Q: What if I have multiple locations?**
A: Current subscription covers 1 location (1 template instance). Multi-location support coming in 2025 (Team Plan: Rp 200K/month for 5 locations).

**Q: Is this a separate product or part of the A1 template?**
A: Separate. The A1 template is a **one-time Rp 200K purchase**. The subscription (R1) is **optional ongoing support** (Rp 75K/month).
