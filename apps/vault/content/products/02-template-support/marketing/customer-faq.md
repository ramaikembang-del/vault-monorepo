## 1. General Questions

### Q1.1: What is the Template Support subscription?

**A:** The Template Support subscription (R1) is an optional add-on service for customers who purchased the A1 Power BI Template. It provides:

- **Monthly template updates** (new metrics, bug fixes, POS compatibility)
- **Priority email and WhatsApp support** (<24-hour response time)
- **Early access** to beta features and new products
- **Learning resources** (tips, tutorials, industry benchmarks)

**Think of it like this:** The A1 template (Rp 200K) is like buying Microsoft Office. The subscription (Rp 75K/month) is like getting Microsoft 365 - ongoing updates and support.

---

### Q1.2: Do I need to buy the A1 template first?

**A:** [x] **YES.** The subscription is only available to customers who purchased the A1 Power BI Template (Rp 200K one-time).

**Why?** The subscription provides updates and support for the A1 template. Without the template, there's nothing to support!

**Purchase flow:**
1. Buy A1 Power BI Template (Rp 200K one-time)
2. Optionally subscribe to R1 Support (Rp 75K/month)

---

### Q1.3: Is the subscription mandatory?

**A:** [x] **NO.** The subscription is **100% optional**.

You can use the A1 template forever without subscribing. However, without a subscription:
- [x] No template updates (you're stuck with the version you purchased)
- [x] No priority support (standard support only: 48-72 hour response)
- [x] No early access to new features

**Recommendation:** Try the template for 2-4 weeks first. If you use it regularly (weekly/monthly), the subscription is worth it.

---

### Q1.4: What happens if I don't subscribe?

**A:** You can still use the A1 template normally. However:

**Without subscription:**
- [x] Template works forever (no expiration)
- [x] Standard support available (48-72 hour response, email only)
- [x] No updates (POS compatibility, bug fixes, new metrics)
- [x] Template may break when POS or Power BI updates
- [x] You'll need to pay Rp 2-5M to rebuild template in 1-2 years

**With subscription:**
- [x] Monthly updates keep template working forever
- [x] Priority support (<24 hours, email + WhatsApp)
- [x] Early access to new features
- [x] Peace of mind (we fix issues, you focus on business)

**Analogy:** Not subscribing is like buying a car but never changing the oil. It works... until it doesn't.

---

### Q1.5: How many people subscribe?

**A:** We're targeting a **30% subscription rate** (3 out of 10 A1 buyers subscribe).

**Why don't 100% subscribe?**
- Some customers use the template infrequently (once every 3-6 months)
- Some have in-house data analysts who can fix issues
- Some prefer to pay per incident (Rp 500K/hour for ad-hoc support)

**Who typically subscribes?**
- Restaurant owners who use the template weekly/monthly
- Restaurants without in-house technical staff
- Restaurants relying on analytics for critical decisions (pricing, menu optimization, staffing)

---

## 2. Subscription Plans & Pricing

### Q2.1: How much does it cost?

**A:** Two plans available:

**Monthly Plan:**
- **Price:** Rp 75,000/month
- **Billing:** Automatically charged on the same day each month
- **Commitment:** None (cancel anytime with 7-day notice)
- **Total Year 1:** Rp 900,000

**Annual Plan:**
- **Price:** Rp 750,000/year (equivalent to Rp 62,500/month)
- **Billing:** Automatically charged once per year
- **Savings:** Rp 150,000/year (2 months free vs monthly plan)
- **Cancellation:** Pro-rated refund if cancelled within 6 months

**+ Tax:** Add 11% PPN (Indonesia VAT) to all prices.
- Monthly: Rp 83,250 (including tax)
- Annual: Rp 832,500 (including tax)

---

### Q2.2: Why should I choose the annual plan?

**A:** **Save Rp 150,000/year** (2 months free) + additional benefits:

**Annual Plan Benefits:**
1. **Cost savings:** Rp 750K/year vs Rp 900K/year (monthly plan)
2. **Grandfathered pricing:** Lock in 2025 pricing for life (even if we raise prices in 2026+)
3. **Priority support:** Annual subscribers get fastest response times
4. **No payment hassle:** Pay once, forget for 12 months

**When to choose monthly:**
- You're unsure if you'll use the template long-term (test for 3-6 months first)
- You prefer flexibility (cancel anytime, no 6-month commitment)
- Cash flow constraints (Rp 75K/month easier than Rp 750K upfront)

**Pro tip:** Start with monthly, upgrade to annual after 3 months if satisfied. We'll credit your monthly payments toward the annual plan.

---

### Q2.3: Can I switch from monthly to annual later?

**A:** [x] **YES!**

**How it works:**
1. Email support@[company].com to request upgrade
2. We calculate your monthly payments (e.g., 3 months Ã— Rp 75K = Rp 225K)
3. You pay the difference (Rp 750K - Rp 225K = Rp 525K)
4. Your annual subscription starts from the upgrade date

**Example:**
- Subscribed monthly in January (paid Rp 75K Ã— 3 = Rp 225K for Jan-Mar)
- Upgrade to annual in April
- Pay Rp 525K (balance for Apr-Mar next year)
- Total Year 1 cost: Rp 750K (same as if you subscribed annually from start)

**Note:** No penalty for starting monthly and upgrading later!

---

### Q2.4: Will prices increase in the future?

**A:** [!] **Possibly, yes.** But you're protected:

**Grandfathered Pricing (Year 1 Subscribers):**
- Subscribe in **2025**  ->  Lock in Rp 75K/month **forever**
- Even if we raise prices to Rp 100K/month in 2026, you still pay Rp 75K/month

**Why might prices increase?**
- Inflation (Indonesia inflation ~3-5%/year)
- Increased service costs (support staff, infrastructure)
- Premium features added (e.g., multi-location dashboards, advanced analytics)

**Price increase policy:**
- 30 days' advance notice via email
- Grandfathered subscribers maintain old pricing
- You can cancel within 30 days if you don't accept new pricing

**Bottom line:** Subscribe in 2025 to lock in the lowest price forever.

---

### Q2.5: Is there a free trial?

**A:** [!] **Not currently** (Sprint 1 launch). However:

**Alternative: 14-Day Money-Back Guarantee** (coming Sprint 2)
- Subscribe for 1 month (Rp 75K)
- If not satisfied within 14 days, email support@[company].com for full refund
- No questions asked

**Why no free trial in Sprint 1?**
- Free trials require credit card infrastructure (Midtrans integration pending)
- Risk of abuse (customers download updates, cancel immediately)

**When will free trial launch?**
- Target: Sprint 3-4 (Month 2-3)
- Format: 14-day trial, no credit card required
- Converts to paid automatically (opt-in required)

### Q4.2: What if my issue isn't resolved in 24 hours?

**Resolution timeline varies by severity:**

| Severity | Response Time | Resolution Target |

| **Critical** (template broken, data loss) | <4 hours | <48 hours |
| **High** (major feature broken) | <24 hours | 3-5 days |

**Complex issues requiring template updates:**

- You'll receive status updates every 48 hours

---

### Q4.3: Can I talk to a real person (phone/video call)?

**A:** [!] **Not included in standard subscription.** Support is email/WhatsApp text only.

**Why no phone/video calls?**
- Cost: Phone support requires 2x more staff (Rp 150K/month subscription would be needed)
- Scalability: Text support allows us to help 5-10 customers simultaneously
- Documentation: Text creates record of issue + solution (easier to reference later)

**Exceptions (phone/video available):**
- **Critical issues** (template completely broken)  ->  We may call you for faster troubleshooting
- **Annual plan subscribers**  ->  1 complimentary 30-minute call per year (optional)
- **Premium support add-on** (coming 2025)  ->  Rp 150K/month for phone + video support

**Non-emergencies on Sunday:** Will be responded to on Monday (standard SLA).

---

## 5. Cancellation & Refunds

**A:** [x] **YES** (with 7-day notice).

**Monthly Plan:**
- Email support@[company].com with cancellation request

- Access continues until end of current paid period
- [x] No refunds for partial months

**Example:**

See full [[products/02-template-support/legal/cancellation-policy|Cancellation Policy]].

---

### Q5.2: What if I'm not satisfied?

**A:** **Different policies for monthly vs annual:**

**Monthly Plan:**
- [x] No refunds (subscription is non-refundable)

**Re-subscription process:**

2. Choose Monthly or Annual plan
3. Pay and access restored within 24 hours
4. Previous support history restored (if within 1-year retention period)

**Grandfathered pricing:**

- After 12 months: Standard pricing applies

**Why no pause feature?**

- Cancel + re-subscribe achieves same outcome

- 3 locations, 1 computer each  ->  3 subscriptions OR 1 Team Plan

---

### Q6.4: What if I customize the template? Will updates overwrite my changes?

**A:** [!] **Yes, updates overwrite customizations.**

**How template updates work:**

**Migration process:**
1. Download new template (we send email with link)
2. Read release notes (lists what changed)
3. Re-import your data into new template
4. Re-apply customizations (custom metrics, colors, logos)
5. Test to ensure everything works
6. Replace old template with new version

**We provide:**
- Migration guide (step-by-step instructions)
- Changelog (list of changes to avoid re-doing work)
- Support (if you need help migrating)

**Tip:** Keep customizations minimal. Heavy customization = harder to update.

---

**A:** [x] **NO** - subscriptions are non-transferable.

**Why not?**
- Subscriptions are licensed per restaurant location (not per person)
- Sharing violates Terms of Service (may result in account termination)

**Who CAN access your subscription?**
- [x] Employees of your restaurant (manager, chef, accountant)
- [x] Business partners (co-owners, investors with legitimate access)
- [x] Family members involved in restaurant operations

**Who CANNOT access your subscription?**
- [x] Friends who own different restaurants (they must buy their own)
- [x] Consultants working with multiple clients (must buy their own or get client to subscribe)
- [x] Competitors or unrelated third parties

**Multi-location scenario:**
- You own Restaurant A and Restaurant B (different locations)
- 1 subscription covers Restaurant A only
- Restaurant B needs separate subscription OR wait for Team Plan (5 locations for Rp 200K/month)
