## OPTION A: ELIMINATE MONTHLY FEE (Recommended)

### Product 01 - Tier 3 Structure:

**Pricing:** **Rp 20-25M one-time**

**Includes:**
- All 100-150 metrics (complete product)
- Fully managed setup
- White-label Excel templates
- **180 days R2 Premium Support** (worth Rp 1.05M)
- **4-6 customizations in Year 1** (worth Rp 3-6M)

**After 180 Days:**
- Customer can subscribe to:
 - R1 Basic (Rp 75K/mo) - updates only
 - R2 Premium (Rp 175K/mo) - updates + 1hr/mo custom
 - R3 Enterprise (Rp 500K/mo) - full managed service

### Revenue Model:

**Year 1:**
- Setup: Rp 22M (average)
- No recurring
- **Total: Rp 22M**

**Year 2-3** (if customer subscribes to support):
- Assume 40% subscribe to R2 (Rp 175K/mo)
- Rp 175K × 12 × 40% = Rp 840K/year
- **3-Year LTV: Rp 23.7M**

### Pros:

 **Brand aligned:** "No monthly fees" applies to ALL tiers
 **Higher Year 1 revenue:** Rp 22M > Rp 16.8M (current)
 **Better LTV:** Rp 23.7M > Rp 21.6M (churn-adjusted current)
 **No churn risk:** Core product owned forever
 **Simpler to sell:** One decision, clear value
 **Market preference:** Indonesian SMEs prefer ownership
 **Resolves R1 conflict:** Support priced separately for all

### Cons:

 **No forced MRR:** Customer must opt-in to support
 **Lower nominal 3-year:** Rp 23.7M vs Rp 26.4M (100% retention fantasy)

### When to Choose:

- If brand promise ("no monthly fees") is sacred
- If want simplicity over complexity
- If targeting ownership-minded buyers
- If confident in support upsell (40%+ likely)

---

## OPTION B: HYBRID MODEL

### Product 01 - Two Tier 3 Options:

**Tier 3A: Premium One-Time**
- **Rp 20M one-time**
- All metrics
- 180 days R1 Basic Support
- 4 customizations included (Year 1)
- **For:** Ownership-minded customers

**Tier 3B: Managed Service**
- **Rp 10M setup + Rp 600K/month**
- All metrics
- Ongoing R3 Enterprise Support (lives in Product 02)
- 2 hours/month custom work
- **For:** Customers who want managed service

### Revenue Model:

**Assumptions:**
- 60% choose 3A (one-time)
- 40% choose 3B (managed)

**3-Year LTV:**
- 3A: Rp 20M × 60% = Rp 12M
- 3B: (Rp 10M + Rp 600K × 36mo) × 40% × 60% retention = Rp 9.3M
- **Average 3-Year LTV: Rp 21.3M**

### Pros:

 **Customer self-selects:** Choose ownership vs managed
 **Subscription priced correctly:** Rp 600K covers Rp 575-950K costs
 **Captures both segments:** Ownership + convenience
 **Higher ceiling:** Some customers happily pay ongoing

### Cons:

 **More complex:** Two options to explain
 **Cannibalization risk:** 3A vs 3B might confuse
 **Split messaging:** Not fully "no monthly fees"

### When to Choose:

- If you want to test both models
- If target market is split on preference
- If willing to manage complexity
- If MRR is strategically important

- **3-Year LTV: Rp 21.4M**

### Pros:
