# Tier 3 Monthly Fee: Critical Analysis
**Date:** December 31, 2025
**Context:** Product 01 (Power BI Template) Tier 3 currently charges Rp 400K/month for support
**Problem:** This conflicts with Product 02 (Template Support) pricing model

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE: PRICING CONFLICT

**Product 01 - Tier 3:**
- Rp 10-15M setup + **Rp 400K/month**
- Includes: Support, consulting, customizations

**Product 02 - R1 Basic Support:**
- **Rp 75K/month**
- Includes: Similar support services

**Problem:** Selling support at TWO different prices (5.3x difference)!

---

## SIX CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

### 1. VALUE-COST MISMATCH

**Tier 3 Promises (Rp 400K/mo):**
- 2 customizations/month
- Monthly maintenance
- Priority support
- Quarterly reviews

**Actual Labor Cost:**
- 2 customizations: 2-4 hours = Rp 300-600K
- Maintenance: 1 hour = Rp 150K
- Support + reviews: 1 hour = Rp 150K
- **Total:** Rp 575-950K/month

**Gross Margin:** **NEGATIVE -44% to -138%**

**Verdict:** Price too low OR service promise unsustainable

---

### 2. "2 CUSTOMIZATIONS/MONTH" = INFINITE LIABILITY

**Problem:** Vague scope definition

**What is "1 customization"?**
- Adding 1 metric (10 min)?
- Rebuilding entire page (4 hours)?
- Changing calculation (30 min)?
- New dashboard section (8 hours)?

**Customer will push boundaries:**
- "I want 10 new metrics" = 1 customization or 10?
- "Rebuild my sales page" = Hours of work

**Business Risk:**
- Unpredictable labor costs
- Scope creep inevitable
- Support burden escalation

**Verdict:** Financial trap without strict time limits

---

### 3. BRAND POSITIONING CONFLICT

**Core Brand Promise (Product 01):**
> "One-time purchase, NO monthly fees, no vendor lock-in"

**Tier 3 Reality:**
> "Rp 10-15M + Rp 400K/month ongoing"

**Problem:** Contradicts #1 differentiator!

**Customer Perception:**
- "You said no monthly fees?"
- "Feels like bait-and-switch"
- "Why is enterprise suddenly SaaS?"

**Competitive Impact:**
- Eliminates advantage vs Tableau/Power BI (who force subscriptions)
- Mixed messaging confuses buyers

**Verdict:** Undermines core positioning

---

### 4. TIER 2 CANNIBALIZATION

**Customer Math:**

**Option A: Tier 3 (12 months)**
- Setup: Rp 12M
- Recurring: Rp 400K × 12 = Rp 4.8M
- **Total Year 1:** Rp 16.8M

**Option B: Tier 2 + Ad-Hoc**
- Setup: Rp 9M (Tier 2 with modules)
- 6 customizations @Rp 500K each = Rp 3M
- **Total Year 1:** Rp 12M

**Result:** Tier 2 + pay-per-project is **Rp 4.8M cheaper!**

**When does Tier 3 make sense?**
- Only if >6 customizations/year
- Or extreme "set-and-forget" convenience

**Verdict:** Self-cannibalization risk

---

### 5. CHURN-ADJUSTED LTV LOWER

**3-Year LTV (Current Model):**
- Year 1: Rp 16.8M
- Year 2: Rp 4.8M × 60% retention = Rp 2.9M
- Year 3: Rp 4.8M × 40% retention = Rp 1.9M
- **Total:** Rp 21.6M

**3-Year LTV (One-Time Alternative):**
- Year 1: Rp 25M (one-time)
- Year 2-3: Optional Rp 3M/yr support renewal
- **Total:** Rp 25M+ (no churn risk)

**Verdict:** Monthly model REDUCES LTV

---

### 6. PRODUCT 02 (R1) CONFLICT

**The Smoking Gun:**

**R1 Template Support (Product 02):**
- Rp 75K/month
- Template updates
- Priority support (<24hr)
- WhatsApp/email help

**Tier 3 Monthly Service:**
- Rp 400K/month
- Similar services + consulting + customizations

**Customer Question:**
> "You sell support for Rp 75K/month to Tier 1/2,
> but I pay Rp 400K/month for Tier 3?
> What am I paying Rp 325K extra for?"

**Answer:** "2 customizations/month"
**But:** We proved those cost Rp 300-600K to deliver!

**Verdict:** **FATAL FLAW** - Can't justify price difference
