# Support Delivery Workflows
**Date:** December 31, 2025
**Purpose:** Operational procedures for R1/R2/R3 support delivery
**Source:** Migrated from Product 01 - Tier 3 specifications

---

## OVERVIEW

This document defines HOW we deliver support across all three tiers.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Time-based limits** prevent scope creep
2. **Transparent tracking** keeps everyone aligned
3. **Clear SLAs** manage expectations
4. **Overage pricing** protects margins

---

## SUPPORT INTAKE PROCESS

### Step 1: Request Submission

**Channels:**
- **R1:** Email or WhatsApp
- **R2:** WhatsApp (priority) or email
- **R3:** Dedicated WhatsApp line or phone

**Required Information:**
- Customer name & tier
- Problem description
- Urgency level
- Preferred response channel

---

### Step 2: Request Classification

**Type A: Question/Troubleshooting** (All tiers)
- "How do I filter by date?"
- "Dashboard not refreshing"
- "Data looks wrong"
- **Action:** Answer within SLA timeframe

**Type B: Custom Work** (R2/R3 only)
- "Add new metric"
- "Modify calculation"
- "Reorganize page"
- **Action:** Estimate time, get approval, schedule

**Type C: Strategic Consulting** (R3 only)
- "How do I improve margins?"
- "What KPIs should I track?"
- **Action:** Schedule for monthly/quarterly call

---

### Step 3: Time Estimation (Custom Work Only)

**Use Service Catalog:**

| Task | Estimated Time | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Simple metric | 15-20 min | Add "Average Order Value" |
| Calculation change | 20-30 min | Modify food cost % formula |
| Visual tweak | 10-15 min | Change color scheme |
| Page reorganization | 30-45 min | Move sections around |
| New dashboard page | 90-120 min | Build "Staff Performance" page |
| Complex integration | 2-4 hours | Connect to new POS system |

**If estimate > monthly allocation:**
- Inform customer of overage cost
- Get approval before proceeding
- OR suggest breaking into multiple months

---

### Step 4: Approval & Scheduling

**For R2 (1 hour/month budget):**
> "This will take ~45 minutes. You have 1 hour this month (0 used). Proceed?"

**For R3 (2 hour/month budget):**
> "This will take ~90 minutes. You have 2 hours this month (0.5 used, 1.5 remaining). Proceed?"

**Customer Confirms:**
- Work added to queue
- Time tracked against monthly allocation
- Delivery estimate provided (usually 2-3 business days)

---

## ⏱ TIME TRACKING SYSTEM

### Monthly Time Budget Tracker

**Simple Spreadsheet Format:**

| Customer | Tier | Monthly Allocation | Used (Hours) | Remaining | Reset Date |
|----------|------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Customer A | R2 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 | Feb 1 |
| Customer B | R3 | 2.0 | 1.8 | 0.2 | Feb 5 |
| Customer C | R2 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | Feb 10 |

**Rules:**
- **No rollover:** Unused hours don't carry to next month
- **Monthly reset:** Fresh allocation on billing anniversary
- **Real-time updates:** Track as work happens, not retroactively

---

### Customer-Facing Time Report
