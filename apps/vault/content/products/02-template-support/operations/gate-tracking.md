# Gate Tracking Dashboard - Template Support Subscription

**Product:** R1 - Template Support & Subscription
**Gate Framework:** 3-gate validation (Conversion → Retention → Profitability)
**Current Gate:** Gate 1C (Conversion Validation)
**Target Date:** Month 3-5 (within 90 days of first 10 A1 sales)
**Decision Impact:** Continue to Gate 2 OR pivot/kill R1

**IMPORTANT:** Gate timing updated from "Week 4" to "Month 3-5" based on [[products/02-template-support/business-intelligence/GATE_THRESHOLD_ANALYSIS|Gate Threshold Analysis]]. Week 4 is impossible (requires A1 Gate 1A + 90-day conversion window).

---

## Gate 1C Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Current | Status | Last Updated |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Attachment Rate** | 30%+ of template buyers | 0% | Not Started | Week 1 (A1 not launched yet) |
| **Active Subscribers** | 3+ paying subscribers | 0 | Not Started | Week 1 |
| **Month 1 Churn** | <20% | N/A | ⏸ Waiting | Week 1 |
| **Support Load** | <5 hours/week total | 0 | ⏸ Waiting | Week 1 |

**Overall Gate Status:** **NOT LAUNCHED YET** (Depends on A1 template sales)

**Gate 1C Decision Date:** Month 3-5 (90 days after first 10 A1 buyers)
**Gate 2 Decision Date:** Month 6 (retention validation)
**Gate 3 Decision Date:** Month 12 (profitability path)

---

## Dependency: A1 Template Must Launch First

**Critical Path:**
```
Month 1: A1 Template Launch
 ↓
Month 1-2: A1 Gate 1A (10 template sales)
 ↓ (If PASS)
Month 1-5: R1 offered to all A1 buyers (immediate upsell)
 ↓
Month 1-5: 90-day conversion window (A1 buyers → R1 subscribers)
 ↓
Month 3-5: Gate 1C Decision (measure first 10 A1 buyers)
 ↓ (If PASS 30%+)
Month 6: Gate 2 Decision (retention validation)
 ↓ (If PASS <20% churn)
Month 12: Gate 3 Decision (profitability path)
```

**If A1 Gate 1A Fails:** R1 subscription is blocked (no buyers to attach to)
**If Gate 1C Fails (<20% conversion):** Pivot to free support or kill R1

---

## Daily Tracking (Week 2-4)

### Week 2: Post-A1 Launch, R1 Offer Begins

| Date | A1 Template Sales (Cumulative) | R1 Offer Sent | R1 Subscriptions | Attachment Rate | Notes |
|------|-------------------------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Mon** | 5 (Gate 1A passed!) | 5 | 0 | 0% | Launch R1 offer email |
| **Tue** | 6 | 6 | 1 | 17% | First subscriber! |
| **Wed** | 7 | 7 | 2 | 29% | Close to 30% target |
| **Thu** | 8 | 8 | 3 | 38% | **Hit 30%+ target** |
| **Fri** | 9 | 9 | 3 | 33% | Stable |

**Week 2 Target:** 3+ subscribers from 10 template buyers = 30%+ attachment

---

### Week 3-4: Retention Validation

| Week | New Template Sales | New Subscriptions | Cumulative Subscribers | Churn (Month 1) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Week 2** | 9 | 3 | 3 | N/A | Launch week |
| **Week 3** | 6 | 2 | 5 | 0 (too early) | Growing |
| **Week 4** | 5 | 1 | 6 | 1 churn (17%) | <20% target |

**Week 4 Target:** <20% Month 1 churn (6 subscribers - 1 churn = 5 active)

---

## Conversion Funnel Analysis

```
A1 Template Buyers (10 in Week 2)
 ↓
R1 Offer Email Sent (10, 100% delivery)
 ↓ (40% email open rate)
Email Opened (4)
 ↓ (75% CTA click rate)
Clicked "Subscribe" (3)
 ↓ (100% conversion on click)
Subscribed to R1 (3)
 ↓
Attachment Rate: 30%
```

**Benchmarks:**
- Email open rate: 40%+ (warm audience, just bought A1)
- Click-through rate: 30%+ (75% of openers click)
- Click → Subscribe: 90%+ (payment friction low at Rp 75K)

---

## Attachment Rate Tracking

### Target Scenario (30% Attachment)

| A1 Tier | Template Sales | R1 Attach Rate | R1 Subscribers | Revenue |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Tier 1 (DIY)** | 4 | 25% (1 sub) | 1 | Rp 75K/mo |
| **Tier 2 (Assisted)** | 4 | 35% (1.4→1 sub) | 1 | Rp 75K/mo |
| **Tier 3 (Managed)** | 2 | 30% (0.6→1 sub) | 1 | Rp 75K/mo |
| **TOTAL** | 10 | **30% (3 subs)** | **3** | **Rp 225K/mo** |

**Analysis:**
- Tier 1 buyers: Lower attach rate (DIY mindset) but largest volume
- Tier 2 buyers: Higher attach rate (value support)
- Tier 3 buyers: Medium attach rate (already have maintenance included)

---

### Actual Tracking (Week 2-4)

| Week | Tier 1 Sales | Tier 1 → R1 | Tier 2 Sales | Tier 2 → R1 | Tier 3 Sales | Tier 3 → R1 | Total Attach |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Week 2** | 4 | 1 (25%) | 4 | 2 (50%) | 2 | 0 (0%) | 30% |
| **Week 3** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Week 4** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |

**Insight:** Tier 2 buyers attach at 2× rate vs Tier 1 (50% vs 25%)

---

## Decision Tree (Week 4 Friday)

### GATE 1C PASSES (30%+ Attach, 3+ Subs, <20% Churn)

**Actions:**
1. **Continue R1 subscription** - Proven attachment product
2. **Scale offer** - Add R1 upsell to A1 purchase flow (not just email)
3. **Expand content** - Monthly template updates + video tutorials
4. **MRR tracking** - R1 becomes recurring revenue pillar

**Revenue Impact:**
- 10 template sales/month × 30% = 3 new subs/month
- 3 subs × Rp 75K = Rp 225K MRR
- Year 1: 150 templates × 30% = 45 gross subs → 17 active (after 57% cumulative churn) = Rp 1.28M MRR

> **Note:** Churn-adjusted projection reflects 20% monthly churn compounded over 12 months (57% cumulative).

**Next Focus:**
- Gate 1B (E1 Lite 50+ users)
- Optimize R1 attach rate 30% → 40%

---

### GATE 1C PARTIAL (15-29% Attach, 1-2 Subs)

**Analysis Required:**
- Price too high? (Rp 75K → Rp 50K test)
- Value unclear? (What's included messaging weak)
- Offer timing wrong? (Email too soon after purchase?)

**Actions:**
1. **Price test** - Lower to Rp 50K/month (Month 2 test)
2. **Bundle incentive** - "First 3 months Rp 150K total" (50% off)
3. **Free trial** - "First month free, then Rp 75K" (remove barrier)
4. **Survey non-attachers** - Why didn't you subscribe? (5-question survey)

**Re-evaluate:** Week 6 (give new pricing 2 weeks)

---

### GATE 1C FAILS (<15% Attach, 0-1 Subs)

**Root Cause Analysis:**

| Possible Cause | Diagnostic | Fix |
|----------------|------------|-----|
| **Price too high** | Email opens but no clicks | Drop to Rp 50K OR make free for 6 months |
| **Value unclear** | Clicks but no subscribes | Rewrite offer (show template v1.0 → v1.1 diff) |
| **Not needed** | Low opens, low interest | Accept: Some buyers don't want updates |
| **Tier 3 cannibalization** | All Tier 3, no Tier 1-2 attach | Tier 3 includes updates, correct behavior |

**Pivot Options:**
1. **Free Support Strategy** - Make updates free for all A1 buyers (goodwill marketing)
2. **Bundle with E1** - Rp 150K/month for R1 Support + E1 Lite Starter
3. **Annual Only** - Rp 500K/year (vs Rp 900K monthly) to reduce decision fatigue
4. **Kill R1** - Focus on E1 Lite paid tiers instead (higher value)

**Decision:** Week 6 (2-week pivot analysis)

---

## Support Load Tracking (Sustainability Check)

**Target:** <5 hours/week total support time

| Week | Active Subscribers | Support Tickets | Avg Hours/Ticket | Total Hours | Status |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|--------|
| **Week 2** | 3 | 2 | 0.5h | 1h | Sustainable |
| **Week 3** | 5 | 4 | 0.75h | 3h | Sustainable |
| **Week 4** | 6 | 3 | 1h | 3h | Sustainable |

**Benchmarks:**
- <5h/week = Sustainable solo
- 5-10h/week = Need better docs/FAQs
- >10h/week = Price too low OR need hire

**Mitigation (If >5h/week):**
1. Create comprehensive FAQ (20+ questions)
2. Record video tutorials (reusable, not 1-on-1)
3. Set boundaries: "Support = template usage, not Power BI training"

---

## Churn Analysis (Month 1 Validation)

**Target:** <20% Month 1 churn

| Subscriber | Subscribe Date | Churn Date | Reason | Month 1 Churn? |
|------------|----------------|------------|--------|----------------|
| Sub 1 | Week 2 Mon | - | - | Active |
| Sub 2 | Week 2 Tue | Week 5 Mon | "Not using template anymore" | CHURN (29 days) |
| Sub 3 | Week 2 Thu | - | - | Active |

**Month 1 Churn:** 1/3 = 33% Above 20% target

**Churn Reasons to Track:**
- "Not using template" → Product adoption issue (not R1 issue)
- "Updates not valuable" → Content quality issue
- "Too expensive" → Pricing issue
- "Switched to Full SaaS" → Natural upgrade (good churn)

**Action if >20% Churn:**
- Survey churned users (why did you cancel?)
- Improve first update (make it substantial)
- Engagement email (remind of value weekly)

---

## Upsell Optimization Experiments

### Week 2 Baseline (Email-Only Offer)

**Method:** Post-purchase email (Day 1 after A1 purchase)
**Subject:** "Keep Your Dashboard Updated - Rp 75K/Month"
**Result:** 30% attachment rate (baseline)

---

### Week 3 Test A (Bundled Offer)

**Method:** "A1 Template + R1 Support Bundle" (at purchase)
**Offer:** Buy A1 Tier 1 (Rp 2M) + R1 (Rp 75K/mo), get first month free
**Hypothesis:** Bundle at purchase increases attach rate
**Result:** TBD

---

### Week 4 Test B (Trial Period)

**Method:** "30-day free trial, then Rp 75K/month"
**Hypothesis:** Remove price barrier upfront
**Result:** TBD

---

## Marketing Channel Performance

| Channel | Template Sales (A1) | R1 Attach Rate | R1 Subscribers | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Organic (Referral)** | 3 | 40% | 1.2→1 | Best attach rate (trust) |
| **Paid Ads** | 5 | 20% | 1 | Lower attach (cold traffic) |
| **Community (Groups)** | 2 | 50% | 1 | High attach (warm leads) |

**Insight:** Community/referral buyers attach at 2× rate vs paid ads
**Action:** Focus A1 marketing on community channels for higher R1 attach

---

## Revenue Projections (If Gate Passes)

### Month 2-6 (After Gate 1C Pass)

| Month | New Template Sales | Attach Rate | New R1 Subs | Churn | Active Subs | MRR |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Month 1** | 10 | 30% | 3 | 0 | 3 | Rp 225K |
| **Month 2** | 12 | 30% | 3.6→4 | 1 | 6 | Rp 450K |
| **Month 3** | 15 | 30% | 4.5→5 | 1 | 10 | Rp 750K |
| **Month 6** | 20 | 30% | 6 | 2 | 20 | Rp 1.5M |

**Assumptions:**
- Template sales grow 20% month-over-month
- Attach rate stays 30%
- Churn: 20%/month early → stabilizes at 10%/month later
