Hi [Name],

Just checking in - did you get the Power BI dashboard set up?

 STILL THINKING ABOUT UPDATES?

Here's what you miss without Template Support:
- When POS system updates format, your dashboard breaks
- When we add new metrics, you don't get them
- When bugs are found, you're stuck with old version

### Week 2: First Value Delivery

**Email (Week 2):**
```
Subject: Template Support Tip #1: How to Spot Revenue Leaks Fast

Hi [Name],

Welcome to your first monthly tip!

**This Month's Tip: Revenue Waterfall Analysis**

Most F&B owners miss revenue leaks because they only look at "Total Sales."

Here's how to catch them using your Power BI dashboard:

1. Open Revenue Intelligence tab
2. Find "Revenue Waterfall" chart
3. Look for these red flags:
 - Discounts >15% of base revenue → Too generous
 - Refunds >2% → Quality or service issues
 - Walkins declining month-over-month → Marketing problem

 Watch 5-min tutorial: [Link]

Try this on your dashboard and reply - I'd love to hear what you discover!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Next update (v1.1) drops in 2 weeks. We're adding customer patronage trends!
