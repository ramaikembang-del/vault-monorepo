# Pay-Per-Insight Product Strategy
**Usage-Based Analytics for Commitment-Averse Customers**

**Product Code:** A2 (Pillar 1 - Acquisition)
**Target Segment:** Phase 1 Mikro, analytics-curious but not ready to commit
**Pricing:** Rp 10-20K per report (pay-as-you-go)

---

## Purpose

Zero-commitment entry point that captures "analytics curious" customers who won't commit to subscriptions but will pay per use.

## Key Features

- **Pay-per-report model:** No subscription, pay only when you need insights
- **Pre-built report templates:** Revenue analysis, staff performance, customer trends
- **Instant delivery:** Generate report in <5 minutes
- **WhatsApp delivery:** Report sent as PDF to WhatsApp

## Market Sizing

- **TAM:** 100,000 restaurants
- **SAM:** 10,000 restaurants (unwilling to pay Rp 300K/month but will pay per use)
- **SOM:** 500-1,000 active users by Year 2

## Pricing

| Report Type | Price |
|-------------|-------|
| Daily Revenue Summary | Rp 10K |
| Weekly Performance Report | Rp 15K |
| Monthly Deep Dive | Rp 20K |
| Custom Report | Rp 25-50K |

## Strategic Value

- **Behavioral data collection:** What reports they generate = what they care about
- **Conversion trigger:** When spending hits Rp 200K+/month → upsell to subscription (cheaper)
- **Risk-free trial:** Customer tests value before committing

## Revenue Projections

- Year 1: Rp 20M (2,000 reports × Rp 10K avg)
- Year 2: Rp 50M (5,000 reports/month at scale)
- Year 3: Rp 100M (10,000 reports/month + premium reports)

## Upgrade Path

→ 3+ reports/month: Suggest Lite Dashboard (Rp 0-350K, unlimited)
→ 5+ reports/month: Suggest Full SaaS Basic (Rp 300K, more features)

**Status:** Backlog (Sprint 4+)
**Dependencies:** Lite Dashboard infrastructure for report generation
