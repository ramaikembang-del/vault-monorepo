## Troubleshooting

**Low Open Rates:**
- Use WhatsApp (best for Indonesia: 70-90% open rate)
- Better subject lines (email): Specific, urgent, benefit-clear
- Send time matters: Avoid early morning/late night

**High Unsubscribe:**
- Don't over-send (max 2x/month promotional)
- Segment better (only send relevant offers)
- Provide value sometimes (not always selling)

**WhatsApp Not Sending:**
- Check Business API approval status
- Ensure message templates approved
- Verify customer opted-in (can't spam cold contacts)

**Low Redemptions:**
- Offer not compelling enough (increase discount)
- Expiration too short (extend to 14 days)
- Redemption process unclear (simplify: "Just show this message")

---

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Start with 2-3 campaigns (Birthday + Win-Back minimum)
- Use WhatsApp for Indonesia (highest engagement)
- Track redemptions (measure what works)
- Personalize (use customer names, reference past orders)
- Test offers (A/B test to optimize)

**Don't:**
- Blast everyone with same message (segment!)
- Over-send (max 2x/month per customer)
- Ignore opt-outs (illegal + bad reputation)
- Generic messages ("Dear Customer" → use {{name}})
- Forget to track ROI (campaigns should pay for themselves 10x+)
