## Pricing Psychology & Indonesian Cultural Context

### 1. "Know Your Cost, Price with Confidence" (Risk Reduction)

**Message:**
> "Guessing your recipe cost = gambling with your margin. One wrong estimate on catering bid = Rp 500K loss. R2c costs Rp 100K/month but saves you from one bad quote."

**Cultural Note:** Indonesian Mikro owners often price based on "feel" or competitor matching, not actual cost. This leads to razor-thin or negative margins. R2c empowers data-driven pricing.

---

### 2. "Stop Leaving Money on the Table" (Opportunity Cost)

**Message:**
> "Your Chocolate Cake costs Rp 20K to make. You charge Rp 45K = 44% COGS. Competitors charge Rp 55K for similar quality. You're losing Rp 10K per cake. Sell 100 cakes/month = Rp 1M lost revenue. R2c costs Rp 100K to fix this."

**Use Case:** Pricing optimizer shows "Raise price to Rp 55K for 36% COGS (healthy margin)."

---

### 3. "Catch Waste Before It Kills Your Business" (Loss Aversion)

**Indonesian Context:** 5-10% food waste is common but rarely tracked.

**Message:**
> "Variance analysis shows: You spent Rp 10M on ingredients but only Rp 9M went into sold products. Where's Rp 1M? Spoilage? Theft? Portion inconsistency? R2c helps you find and fix leaks."

---

## Bundle Strategy (Deep-Dive)

### Bundle 1: R2a + R2c "Production Business Essentials"

**Value Proposition:**
> "P&L (R2a) tells you IF you're profitable. COGS (R2c) tells you WHY. Together = complete picture."

**Pricing:**
- R2a Standard: Rp 100K
- R2c Standard: Rp 100K
- **Bundle:** Rp 150K (save Rp 50K - 25%)

**Retention Benefit:**
- **Unbundle Friction:** Canceling R2c means losing COGS visibility (scary for production businesses)
- **Cross-Module Insights:** R2a shows "Profit down 10%", R2c shows "COGS up from 30%  ->  35%" (actionable)

**Target:** 60% of R2c subscribers bundle with R2a (vs 40% standalone R2c)

---

### Bundle 2: E1 + R2a + R2c "Complete CFO Stack"

**The Ultimate Mikro Business Dashboard:**
- **E1 Starter:** Revenue, customers, staff hours analytics (Rp 200K)
- **R2a Standard:** P&L, expense tracking (Rp 100K)
- **R2c Standard:** Recipe costing, COGS analysis (Rp 100K)
- **Total Standalone:** Rp 400K
- **Bundle Price:** Rp 300K (save Rp 100K - 25%)

**Value Proposition:**
> "Know EVERYTHING about your business: Sales trends, profitable menu items, expense leaks, recipe costs. All for Rp 300K/month. Cheaper than hiring one bookkeeper."

**Target:** Power users (Phase 2.5-3 businesses serious about scaling)

---

## Monetization Roadmap

**Month 1-3 (Launch):**
- Launch at Rp 75K Basic, Rp 100K Standard
- Offer "Early Adopter" discount: Rp 100K  ->  Rp 75K for first 3 months (lock in 20 customers)
- Goal: 15 paying customers by Week 10 (Gate 2B)

**Month 4-6 (Optimization):**
- A/B test annual plan: Rp 1M/year (save Rp 200K = 2 months free)
- Launch R2a+R2c bundle at Rp 150K (promote to existing R2a customers)
- Expected: 40% of R2c users bundle (10 customers Ã— Rp 150K = Rp 1.5M MRR)

**Month 7-12 (Scale):**
- Introduce Premium tier (Rp 150K/month):
 - Unlimited recipes
 - Custom COGS reports
 - 1-on-1 monthly strategy call (pricing optimization consulting)
- Launch "CFO Stack" bundle (E1+R2a+R2c = Rp 300K)
- Expected: 50 R2c customers, 30% on Premium = Rp 5.5M MRR

## Pricing Experiments (A/B Tests)

### Test 1: Annual vs Monthly Pricing

**Hypothesis:** Annual plan improves LTV and retention

**Control:** Rp 100K/month (paid monthly)
**Variant:** Rp 1M/year (save Rp 200K = 16.7% discount)

**Expected Outcome:**
- 20-30% of users choose annual (lower CAC, guaranteed 12-month retention)
- LTV increases from Rp 1.8M (18 months avg) to Rp 2.4M (24 months for annual subscribers)

---

### Test 2: "Recipe Audit" Paid Onboarding

**Hypothesis:** Offering paid setup service increases activation

**Offer:** "We'll build your first 10 recipes for you - Rp 500K one-time"

**Rationale:** Recipe entry is the #1 activation barrier (60% of sign-ups never create 5+ recipes)

**Expected Outcome:**
- 15-20% pay for setup (Rp 500K Ã— 15 customers = Rp 7.5M one-time revenue)
- 90% activation rate for paid setup users (vs 60% DIY activation)

---

## Pricing Decision Framework

**When to Increase Prices:**
1. NPS >60 (users love it)
2. Churn <10% (not price-sensitive)
3. Comparing features expand significantly (e.g., add API integration to supplier systems)

**When to Offer Discounts:**
1. Gate 2B fails (<10 customers by Week 10)  ->  Offer Rp 50K intro tier temporarily
2. High CAC (>Rp 500K)  ->  Offer referral credits (Rp 50K off for referrer + referee)
3. Bundle attach rate <30%  ->  Increase bundle discount from 14% to 25%
