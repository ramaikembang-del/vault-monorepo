## Product-Specific Questions

**Q: What does R2c calculate?**
A:
- Recipe costs (cost per dish)
- Actual COGS (cost of goods sold daily/monthly)
- Food cost % (COGS / Revenue)
- Menu item profitability
- Wastage tracking

**Q: How do I set up recipes?**
A:
1. Add ingredients (name, unit, cost per unit)
2. Create recipes (dish name, ingredients + quantities)
3. R2c calculates cost automatically

**Example:**
- Ingredient: Chicken breast (Rp 50K/kg)
- Recipe: Grilled Chicken (uses 200g) = Rp 10K COGS

**Q: Do I need to enter every ingredient?**
A: For accurate COGS, yes. Start with top 10 items (80% of sales), expand over time.

**Q: Can I import recipes from Excel?**
A: Yes! Download template, fill in, upload. Faster than manual entry.

**Q: How does R2c track actual COGS?**
A: Links recipe costs to POS sales data.
- Sold 50 Grilled Chicken today
- Each costs Rp 10K
- Total COGS = Rp 500K

**Q: What if ingredient prices change?**
A: Update ingredient cost in R2c. Historical data keeps old costs (accurate for that time).

**Q: Can I track wastage?**
A: Yes. Enter wasted items daily (spoilage, mistakes, etc.). R2c calculates wastage cost.

**Q: Recipe cost seems wrong**
A: Check:
- Ingredient units correct? (kg vs g, L vs mL)
- Quantities correct? (200g not 200kg!)
- Latest ingredient prices updated?

**Q: Can I see which items are most/least profitable?**
A: Yes. Reports  ->  "Item Profitability". Sort by profit margin or total profit.

**Q: Do I need R2a to use R2c?**
A: No, but they work great together. R2c calculates COGS, R2a uses it in P&L.
