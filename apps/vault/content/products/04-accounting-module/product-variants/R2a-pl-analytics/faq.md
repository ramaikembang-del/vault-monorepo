**Q: Does R2a integrate with accounting software?**
A: Yes! Export to Accurate Online, Jurnal.id, or Excel for your accountant.

A:
- **R2a:** Simple P&L for F&B (fast, easy, affordable)

Use both: R2a for daily insights, full accounting for year-end taxes.

A: Yes. Each outlet gets its own P&L. Consolidated view also available.
