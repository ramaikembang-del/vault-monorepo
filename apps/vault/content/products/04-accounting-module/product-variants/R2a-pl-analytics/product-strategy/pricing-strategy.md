## Strategic Pricing Framework

### Positioning in Product Ecosystem
R2a sits between **low-commitment products** (E1 Lite Free, A1 Template) and **high-value products** (Full SaaS C1-C4). Our pricing must:
1. Be **accessible** to Phase 1-2 Mikro businesses (limited budgets)
2. Create **upgrade path** from free/template products
3. **Bundle effectively** with analytics (E1, A1) for retention
4. Leave **headroom** for R2c/R2f/C1 upsells

**Cross-Reference:** See [[biz/strategy/planning/foundations/06-prioritization-framework|08-prioritization-framework.md]] for scoring methodology.

## Bundle Strategy (Deep-Dive)

### Bundle 1: Analytics + Accounting (E1 + R2a)

**The "All-In-One Growth Stack"**

| Product | Standalone | Bundle | Monthly Savings |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| E1 Starter (15 metrics) | Rp 200,000 |  -  |  -  |

**Value Proposition:**
> "You already track revenue, staff, and customers with E1. Add R2a for just Rp 50K more and know your PROFIT too. Complete business visibility."

**Retention Benefit:**

**Target:** 40% of E1 Starter subscribers (high intent to bundle)

---

**The "Template Upgrade"**

**Target:** 30% of A1 + R1 buyers (template-first customers)

---

**The "Complete Mikro CFO"** (Month 6+)

## Competitive Pricing Analysis (Extended)

### Indonesian Accounting Software Landscape

| Solution | Monthly Cost | Target Market | Our Positioning |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **R2a Simple P&L** | **Rp 75K** | Mikro (1-3 outlets) | **Simplified for non-accountants** |
| Jurnal (Mekari) | Rp 200K - Rp 500K | SME (5-20 outlets) | Full accounting, complex |
| Accurate Online | Rp 200K - Rp 400K | SME (10+ outlets) | Desktop legacy, learning curve |
| Wave (International) | Free (USD model) | Freelancers (not F&B) | Not IDR, no SAK EMKM |
| **Excel / Sheets** | **Free** | DIY enthusiasts | **Manual labor**, error-prone |
| **Freelance Accountant** | **Rp 1-3M/month** | Established businesses | Done-for-you, expensive |

**Market Gap We Fill:**
- **Above:** Free Excel (too manual, fragile)
- **Below:** Jurnal/Accurate (too complex, expensive)
- **Sweet Spot:** Automated P&L for Mikro F&B, SAK EMKM compliant, Rp 75K.

## Pricing Psychology & Indonesian Cultural Context

### 1. "Cheaper Than Your Time" (Opportunity Cost)
**Message:**
> "Excel P&L takes 5 hours/month. If your time is worth Rp 20K/hour (minimum wage Jakarta), that's Rp 100K in labor. We charge Rp 75K. You save Rp 25K + get automation."

**Cultural Note:** Indonesian Mikro owners often undervalue their own time. Reframe as "What could you do with those 5 hours? Serve 20 more customers = Rp 400K revenue."

---

### 2. "The Cost of Blindness" (Risk Mitigation)
**Message:**
> "Not knowing your Net Profit = flying blind. Common mistakes we catch:
> - Utility bill doubled (leaked pipe) = Rp 500K waste
> - COGS crept from 30% to 38% (supplier price increase) = Rp 2M/year loss
> - One caught mistake pays for yearly subscription."

**Cultural Note:** "Ewuh Pakewuh" (reluctance to ask) means owners won't ask accountants basic questions. R2a removes that barrier.

---

### 3. "Bank Ready" (Status Signal - "Naik Kelas")
**Message:**
> "Need a KUR loan (Kredit Usaha Rakyat)? Banks reject handwritten notebooks.
> Our SAK EMKM PDF = professional, standardized, approved format.
> Worth subscription just for loan approval chance (KUR = Rp 50M+ at 6% vs 18% bank rate)."

**Cultural Note:** "Naik Kelas" (social climbing) motivation. R2a helps Mikro businesses "look professional" to banks/investors.

---

### 4. "Kopitiam Test" (Anchor to Daily Spend)
**Message:**
> "Rp 75K/month = Rp 2,500/day = Price of 1 cup of coffee.
> Would you trade 1 coffee/day for knowing if your business is profitable? Easy choice."

**Cultural Note:** Indonesian F&B cultural anchor. "Price of 3 coffees for a month" feels trivial.

---

## Pricing Experiments & A/B Tests

### Test 1: Annual vs Monthly (Commitment Lock-In)

**Hypothesis:** Offering annual upfront improves LTV and reduces churn.

**Pricing:**
- **Monthly:** Rp 75K Ã— 12 = Rp 900K/year
- **Annual:** Rp 750K/year (2 months free, 17% discount)

**Expected Outcome:**
- 30% choose annual (cash-strapped prefer monthly)
- Annual users have 50% lower churn (sunken cost fallacy)

**Test Duration:** Month 3-6

---

### Test 2: "First Month Rp 10K" vs "30-Day Free Trial"

**Hypothesis:** Rp 10K introductory price converts better than "free trial" (commitment bias).

**Variant A:** "First month Rp 10K, then Rp 75K"
**Variant B:** "30 days free, then Rp 75K"

**Expected Outcome:**
- Rp 10K has lower trial start rate BUT higher Month 2 conversion (paid users more committed)
- Free trial has higher trial starts BUT higher Month 2 churn

**Indonesian Context:** "Free" triggers "ada apa-apanya" (what's the catch?) suspicion. Rp 10K signals "real product."

---

### Test 3: Bundle Discount % (Optimal Savings)

**Hypothesis:** 20% bundle discount converts better than 15% or 25%.

**Variant A:** E1 + R2a = Rp 255K (15% off)
**Variant B:** E1 + R2a = Rp 250K (17% off)
**Variant C:** E1 + R2a = Rp 240K (20% off)

**Expected Outcome:** 17% is optimal (feels generous but not desperate).

---

## Churn Analysis & Pricing Pressure

### Acceptable Churn Rates

**Month 1 Churn:** <20% (trial period, expected attrition)
**Month 3+ Churn:** <10% (steady-state, indicates product value)

**Churn Triggers:**
1. **"Too Expensive"**  ->  Offer downgrade to Basic (Rp 50K) instead of canceling
2. **"Not Using It"**  ->  Symptom: 0 expenses logged in 2 weeks. Intervention: Email nudge.
3. **"POS Import Broken"**  ->  Critical. Fix immediately (engineering escalation).

### Pricing-Related Churn Prevention

**If "Too Expensive":**
- Offer: **"Reduce to Rp 50K Basic tier"** (retain 67% MRR vs 0%)
- Offer: **"Pause for 30 days"** (retain customer, resume later)

**If "Not Getting Value":**
- Highlight unused features: "Did you know you can WhatsApp expenses? Try it!"
- Send: **Monthly tips email** (How to read your P&L, COGS % benchmarks)

---

## LTV:CAC Economics

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Assumptions:**
- Avg subscriber tier: Standard (Rp 75K/month)
- Avg lifetime: 18 months (industry benchmark for Mikro SaaS)
- Monthly churn: 8% (healthy)

**Calculation:**
```
LTV = Avg Monthly Revenue Ã— Avg Lifetime
LTV = Rp 75,000 Ã— 18 months = Rp 1,350,000
```

**With Bundles:**
- 40% bundle with E1 (Rp 250K total, R2a portion = Rp 75K)
- Bundled users stay 24 months (lower churn due to cross-product lock-in)
- **Bundled LTV = Rp 75,000 Ã— 24 = Rp 1,800,000** (+33%)

---

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Channels:**
1. **Email to existing users (A1/E1):** Rp 5K/subscriber (nearly free)
2. **Facebook/Instagram Ads:** Rp 150K/subscriber (competitive keywords)
3. **Referrals:** Rp 25K/subscriber (referral bonus Rp 50K shared)

**Blended CAC:** Rp 75K (weighted avg across channels)

---

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Target:** 3:1 (healthy SaaS benchmark)

**Current Projection:**
```
LTV:CAC = Rp 1,350,000 / Rp 75,000 = 18:1 (Excellent!)
```

**Why so high?**
- Low CAC (existing user base from A1/E1)
- Reasonable LTV (18-month retention)
- **Risk:** Over-reliance on cross-sell. If A1/E1 don't scale, R2a stalls.

---
