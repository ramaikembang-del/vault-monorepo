## Product-Specific Questions

**Q: What's the difference between P&L and Cash Flow?**
A:
- **P&L (R2a):** When you earned money (accrual basis)
- **Cash Flow (R2b):** When cash actually moved (cash basis)

**Example:** Sold catering for Rp 10M on Jan 15, paid Feb 5.
- P&L: Revenue Jan 15
- Cash Flow: Cash in Feb 5

**Q: Why do I need both?**
A: P&L shows profitability. Cash Flow shows "can I pay rent this month?"

**Q: What does R2b track?**
A:
- Cash in (sales, loans, owner investment)
- Cash out (expenses, loan payments, owner withdrawal)
- Cash balance (opening + in - out)
- Cash runway (how many months until cash runs out)

**Q: How does R2b know my cash balance?**
A: Enter starting cash balance once. R2b calculates from there based on cash in/out.

**Q: Can I connect my bank account?**
A: Not yet (coming Q2 2025). Currently manual entry for non-POS transactions (rent, utilities, etc.).

**Q: I have multiple bank accounts - can I track separately?**
A: Yes. Settings  ->  Cash Accounts  ->  Add account (BCA, Mandiri, Cash Register, etc.).

**Q: What's "cash runway"?**
A: Months of cash remaining at current burn rate.
Example: Rp 30M cash, spending Rp 10M/month = 3 months runway.

**Q: Cash flow shows negative - is that bad?**
A: Depends:
- **Temporarily negative:** Normal (e.g., paid suppliers before receiving sales)
- **Consistently negative:** Warning sign (spending more than earning)

**Q: Can I forecast future cash flow?**
A: Yes. Enter expected future expenses/revenue. R2b projects cash balance.
