## Target Market

**Primary:** Phase 2.5-3 businesses with complex cash timing
- Multi-outlet (juggling multiple locations' cash)

**NOT For:**
- Phase 1 Mikro (simple cash = use notebook)
- Enterprises (need full CFO + finance team)

---

## Upgrade Path

**R2a (P&L)  ->  R2b (Cash Flow):** When profit looks good but "Why am I always short on cash?"
**R2b  ->  Full Accounting:** When open 5+ outlets OR need multi-currency
