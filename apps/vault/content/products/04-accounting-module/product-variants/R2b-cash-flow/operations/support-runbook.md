### 2. "What's My Runway? It Shows N/A" (25%)

**Symptom:** Runway calculator shows "N/A" or "Insufficient Data"

**Root Cause:** Missing burn rate (no recurring expenses set up)

**Fix Script:**
```
Subject: Fixing Your Runway Calculator

Hi [Name],

Your runway shows "N/A" because we need your monthly burn rate.

Quick fix (5 minutes):
1. Dashboard → "Recurring Expenses"
2. Add your regular bills:
 - Rent: Rp [___] (due 1st each month)
 - Payroll: Rp [___] (due 25th)
 - Utilities: Rp [___] (estimated)
 - Suppliers: Rp [___] (weekly/monthly)

3. Save → Runway calculates automatically!

Example:
Cash: Rp 25M
Monthly Burn: Rp 18M (sum of recurring expenses)
Runway: 1.4 months

### 3. "Why Does Forecast Show I'll Run Out of Cash?" (20%)

**Symptom:** User sees red alert "Projected cash: -Rp 5M in 15 days"

**Fix Script:**
```
Subject: Understanding Your Cash Forecast (No Panic!)

Hi [Name],

Your forecast shows cash shortfall in 15 days. Here's what it means:

**Current Situation:**
- Cash today: Rp 10M
- Bills due next 15 days: Rp 15M
- Expected income: Rp 8M
→ Shortfall: Rp 10M + Rp 8M - Rp 15M = Rp 3M short

**This is NORMAL for growing businesses.** Here's what to do:

**Option 1: Delay Non-Urgent Bills**
- Rent (Rp 15M) critical → can't delay
- Equipment purchase (Rp 5M) optional → postpone to next month
→ Saves Rp 5M shortfall

**Option 2: Accelerate Income**
- Invoice payment (Rp 8M) due in 20 days → call customer, ask for early payment
→ Get Rp 8M now instead of later

**Option 3: Bridge Financing**
- Short-term loan Rp 5M for 15 days
- Or owner injection

### 4. "Payment Reminder Didn't Work" (10%)

**Symptom:** User missed a bill despite setting reminder

**Fix Script:**
```
Subject: Fixing Payment Reminders

Hi [Name],

Sorry you missed the [Supplier X] payment! Let's fix reminders:

**Check:**
1. WhatsApp number correct? (Dashboard → Settings → My Number)
2. WhatsApp notifications ON? (check phone settings)
3. Reminder timing: Currently 3 days before due. Want 5 days? (change in settings)

**Pro Tip:** Set "Critical" priority for must-pay bills (rent, payroll).
→ R2b sends daily reminders starting 7 days before + SMS backup.

[Update Reminder Settings]

[Support Rep]

### 5. "What's the Difference Between Cash Flow and P&L (R2a)?" (8%)

**Educational Response:**
```
Subject: P&L vs Cash Flow - Why You Need Both

Hi [Name],

Great question! They're different:

**R2a (P&L) = Profitability**
- Shows: Revenue - Expenses = Profit
- Example: "December profit: Rp 10M"

**R2b (Cash Flow) = Survival**
- Shows: Cash IN - Cash OUT = Runway
- Example: "Cash runway: 2.3 months at current burn"

**You can be profitable but cash-poor:**
- Scenario: Profit Rp 10M this month, but customer pays net-30 (invoice Rp 50M comes in February).
- Meanwhile: Rent Rp 15M due Jan1, payroll Rp 20M due Jan 25.
- P&L says "profitable!" but Cash Flow says "short Rp 25M in January."

**Bottom Line:** R2a = long-term health. R2b = short-term survival. Need both!

Bundle pricing: R2a + R2b = Rp 150K/month (save Rp 50K).

[Add R2a to Bundle]

### 6-10. Less Common Issues (3-5% each)

**6. "How to Model a New Hire Impact?"**
- Use "Scenario Planning" (Standard tier): Add Rp 5M/month payroll → See new runway

**7. "Can I Track Multiple Locations Separately?"**
- Yes! Add each location as separate "cash bucket." R2b shows combined + individual.

**8. "Bank sync stopped working"**
- Re-authenticate: Settings → Bank Accounts → "Reconnect BCA"

**9. "How to export cash report?"**
- Dashboard → Reports → "Cash Flow Statement" → PDF

**10. "What if I run out of cash?"**
- Urgent: Contact us immediately. We'll help prioritize bills + bridge options.

## Bundling Upsell (Users with R2a Only)

**Trigger:** User has R2a (P&L) but not R2b (Cash)

**Email:**
```
Subject: You're Profitable... But Do You Know Your Cash Runway?

Hi [Name],

Great job using R2a! Your P&L shows Rp 8M profit last month.

Quick question: What's your cash runway?
(How many months until you run out of cash?)

Don't know? You're not alone. 40% of profitable businesses fail due to cash flow, not lack of profit.

**Add R2b (Cash Flow) to your R2a:**
- Know exact runway (e.g., "2.8 months cash left")
- 30-day forecast (see shortfalls ahead)
- Payment reminders (never miss supplier bill)

**Bundled Pricing:**
- R2a alone: Rp 100K
- R2b alone: Rp 100K
- R2a + R2b Bundle: Rp 150K (save Rp 50K!)

[Add R2b for Rp 50K/month extra]

Best,
[CS Team]
