## Strategic Pricing Framework

### Positioning in R2 Series

R2b addresses "profitable but cash-poor" paradox - different pain than R2a (P&L) or R2c (COGS).

**Stack Positioning:**
- **R2a (P&L):** Rp 50-100K - Am I profitable?
- **R2c (COGS):** Rp 75-100K - What does each product cost?
- **R2b (Cash Flow):** Rp 75-100K - Will I run out of cash?
- **Bundle:** R2a+R2b+R2c Rp 225K - Complete CFO view

**Cross-Reference:** [[biz/strategy/planning/foundations/06-prioritization-framework|08-prioritization-framework.md]] for R2b rank #9.

## Pricing Tiers

### Basic Tier (Rp 75,000/month)

**Target Persona:** Phase 2.5 (2-3 outlets, starting to scale)

**Features:**
- Track up to 3 bank accounts
- 30-day cash forecast
- 10 recurring payment reminders
- Runway calculator
- Email alerts only

**Why Rp 75K?**
- **One Late Payment Avoided:** Supplier late fee Rp 500K  ->  R2b costs Rp 75K/month = 6.7Ã— ROI in Month 1
- **Below Accountant:** Fractional CFO Rp 5M/month (we're 98.5% cheaper for cash piece)
- **Accessible for Phase 2.5:** Rp 75K = 0.15% of typical Rp 50M/month revenue

**Expected Adoption:** 60% of R2b subscribers (most users)

---

### Standard Tier (Rp 100,000/month) - **CORE OFFER** [*]

**Target Persona:** Phase 3 (multi-outlet, B2B catering, rapid scaling)

**Features (All Basic PLUS):**
- Unlimited bank accounts
- 60-day cash forecast
- Unlimited recurring payments
- Scenario planning ("What if I cut costs 20%?")
- Auto-sync with R2a/R2f (if user has)
- WhatsApp alerts (<1 hour to payment due)

**Why Rp 100K?**
- **Cash Crisis Prevention:** Running out of cash = business death. Prevention worth Rp 100K/month easily.
- **ROI Clear:** Multi-outlet owner juggling Rp 100M cash across 5 locations. One transfer mistake = Rp 5M+ problem. R2b prevents this.

**Bundle Economics:**
| Bundle | Standalone Total | Bundle Price | Savings |
|--------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| R2a + R2b | Rp 200K | Rp 150K | Rp 50K (25%) |
| R2a + R2b + R2c | Rp 300K | Rp 225K | Rp 75K (25%) |

**Bundle Rationale:**
- **P&L + Cash Flow = Complete Picture:** Profitable (R2a) but cash-poor (R2b)  ->  Need both
- **Retention:** Bundled users 50% less likely to churn (solving intertwined problems)

## Pricing Psychology & Indonesian Context

### 1. "Know When You'll Run Out of Cash" (Survival Instinct)

**Message:**
> "Are you profitable but always short on cash? You're not alone. 60% of F&B businesses fail due to cash flow, NOT unprofitability. R2b shows your runway in seconds: 'You have 2.3 months cash left at current burn rate.' Worth Rp 100K/month to avoid business death?"

**Cultural Note:** Indonesian Mikro owners often mix personal/business cash. R2b forces separation  ->  clarity.

---

### 2. "Never Miss a Supplier Payment Again" (Relationship Preservation)

**Indonesian Context:** Supplier relationships are everything. Late payment = damaged trust, future credit denied.

**Message:**
> "Missed supplier payment last month? Got charged Rp 500K late fee + supplier now demands cash-only (no more credit). R2b WhatsApp alert 3 days before due = maintain good supplier relationships. Rp 100K/month insurance."

---

### 3. "Juggling Multi-Location Cash? Stop Guessing" (Complexity Reduction)

**Use Case:** Multi-outlet owner

**Message:**
> "You have 5 locations. Location A has Rp 20M cash, Location B needs Rp 15M for tomorrow's supplier payment. Do you transfer? Guess wrong = overdraft fees OR supplier default. R2b shows combined cash + alerts = no more guessing."

---

## Bundle Strategy (Deep-Dive)

### Bundle 1: R2a + R2b "Profit & Cash Mastery"

**Value Proposition:**
> "Profit (R2a) and Cash (R2b) are different. You can be profitable but run out of cash (payment timing mismatch). Both for Rp 150K/month  ->  complete financial visibility."

**Pricing:**
- Standalone: Rp 100K + Rp 100K = Rp 200K
- Bundle: Rp 150K (save Rp 50K - 25%)

**Why Discount?** Cross-insights (R2a shows profit up, R2b shows cash down  ->  investigate why). Bundled users stay longer.

**Target:** 70% of R2b users bundle with R2a (high attach rate)

---

### Bundle 2: R2a + R2b + R2c "Complete CFO Stack"

**The Ultimate Mikro Finance Suite:**
- R2a: Profit & Loss
- R2b: Cash Flow & Runway
- R2c: Recipe Costing & COGS

**Standalone:** Rp 300K total
**Bundle:** Rp 225K (save Rp 75K - 25%)

**Value Proposition:**
> "For Rp 225K/month, know: Are you profitable? (R2a), Will you run out of cash? (R2b), Does each menu item make money? (R2c). Cheaper than 1 week of accountant time (Rp 1.2M/week)."

**Target:** Power users (Phase 3 production businesses serious about scaling)

---

## Monetization Roadmap

**Month 1-3 (Launch):**
- Launch at Rp 75K Basic, Rp 100K Standard
- Offer "Cash Crisis Survivor" discount: First month 50% off (Rp 50K) for businesses with <3 months runway
- Goal: 12 paying customers by Week 14 (Gate 2C)

**Month 4-6 (Optimization):**
- A/B test annual plan: Rp 1M/year (save Rp 200K)
- Launch R2a+R2b bundle at Rp 150K (target existing R2a customers)
- Expected: 70% of R2b users bundle  ->  Rp 1.8M MRR from bundles

**Month 7-12 (Scale):**
- Introduce "Cash Flow Consultant" add-on: Rp 200K/month extra for monthly 30-min CFO call
- Launch API access (Premium tier upgrade for Rp 50K/month extra)
- Expected: 15 R2b customers, 10 bundled  ->  Rp 2.5M MRR

## Pricing Experiments (A/B Tests)

### Test 1: "Crisis Discount" for Low-Runway Businesses

**Hypothesis:** Businesses in cash crisis (<2 months runway) convert higher with urgency discount

**Control:** Rp 100K/month (standard pricing)
**Variant:** Rp 50K first month if "Runway <2 months" (detected from onboarding)

**Expected Outcome:**
- 40% conversion (variant) vs 20% (control)
- Higher initial volume compensates for discount
- Month 2+ revert to full price (once runway improved)

---

### Test 2: Bank Integration Premium

**Hypothesis:** Auto bank sync is worth premium vs manual entry

**Control:** Rp 100K/month (manual cash entry)
**Variant:** Rp 120K/month (auto bank sync with BCA/Mandiri)

**Expected Outcome:**
- 30% choose auto-sync variant (convenience worth Rp 20K extra)
- Lower churn for auto-sync users (less manual work = stickier)

---

## Pricing Decision Framework

**When to Increase Prices:**
1. Runway calculator prevents 1+ cash crisis/year for 80%+ users (proven ROI)
2. NPS >65 (users love it)
3. Churn <10%/year

**When to Discount:**
1. Free  ->  Paid conversion from R2a <20% (need bundle incentive)
2. Gate 2C fails (<8 customers) - offer Rp 50K entry tier
3. Competitive threat (new cash flow tool enters market)
