## Quick Start

### Why Cash Flow Matters
"Sales are vanity, profit is sanity, cash is reality."

You can be profitable but run out of cash! Track where money actually flows.

### First Setup
1. Enter starting cash balance (bank + cash register)
2. Connect revenue (from POS)
3. Enter cash expenses (rent, supplier payments, etc.)
4. See cash balance daily!

## Cash Flow vs P&L

| P&L (R2a) | Cash Flow (R2b) |
|-----------|-----------------|
| When you earned | When you got paid |
| Accrual basis | Cash basis |
| Profitability | Liquidity |

**Example:**
- Sold catering Rp 10M (Jan 15) → P&L: Jan revenue
- Got paid (Feb 5) → Cash Flow: Feb cash in

## Tracking Cash

**Cash In:**
- Daily sales (POS)
- Catering deposits
- Loans
- Owner investment

**Cash Out:**
- Supplier payments
- Rent
- Salaries
- Loan payments
- Owner withdrawal
- Taxes

**Cash Balance:**
Opening Balance + Cash In - Cash Out = Ending Balance

## Cash Runway

**"How many months until we run out of cash?"**

Calculation:
```
Current cash: Rp 30,000,000
Monthly burn: Rp 10,000,000
Runway: 3 months
```

**Warning:** <3 months runway = urgent action needed!

## Cash Flow Forecast

**Plan ahead:**
1. Enter expected future cash in/out
2. R2b projects future balance
3. Spot cashproblems before they happen

**Example:**
- Rent due next week (Rp 15M)
- Projected balance goes negative
- Action: Delay supplier payment OR get short-term loan

---

## Multiple Bank Accounts

**Track separately:**
1. Settings → Cash Accounts
2. Add each account (BCA, Mandiri, Cash Register)
3. Allocate cash in/out to specific account
4. See balance per account + total

---

## Best Practices

**Daily habits:**
- Update cash transactions daily (5 min)
- Check cash balance every morning

**Weekly review:**
- Compare projected vs actual
- Adjust forecast

**Monthly:**
- Reconcile with bank statements
- Plan next month's cash needs
