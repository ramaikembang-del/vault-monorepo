# Retention Strategy - R2 Accounting Module
**Product:** R2 - Analytics Suite / Accounting Module
**Goal:** <20% annual churn (<2% monthly)
**Current Baseline:** TBD (track from Month 1)

---

## Churn Prevention Framework

### Target Metrics
- **Month 1 Churn:** <20% (trial → paid critical period)
- **Month 2-3 Churn:** <10%
- **Month 4+ Churn:** <5%
- **Annual Churn:** <20% total

---

## Churn Risk Segments

### Segment 1: Never Activated (25% of churners)
**Profile:** Signed up but never used (0 expenses entered)

**Root Cause:** Onboarding friction (too complex to setup)

**Prevention:**
- Day 1 manual setup help (WhatsApp call)
- Offer screen-share setup (do it FOR them)
- Simplify CSV import (accept more formats)

**Success:** Reduce never-activated from 25% → 10%

---

### Segment 2: Low Engagement (40% of churners)
**Profile:** Used 1-2 weeks, then stopped

**Root Cause:** Didn't form habit (forgot to use)

**Prevention:**
- Weekly WhatsApp reminder: "Remember to input expenses this week!"
- Gamification: "You're on 3-week streak - keep it going! "
- Monthly P&L summary auto-email (show value even if not logging in)

**Success:** Increase Weekly Active Users from 60% → 80%

---

### Segment 3: Price Sensitivity (20% of churners)
**Profile:** "Rp 50K too expensive for small warung"

**Root Cause:** Budget constraints (Phase 0-1 Mikro)

**Prevention:**
- Offer annual discount (Rp 500K/year = Rp 41K/month, 18% off)
- Create micro tier: Rp 30K/month (basic features only)
- Bundle with A1/E1 (perceived value increases)

**Success:** Retain 50% of price-sensitive customers with discount

---

### Segment 4: Feature Mismatch (15% of churners)
**Profile:** "R2 too simple, I need Jurnal" OR "R2 lacks tax filing"

**Root Cause:** Wrong product fit (enterprise needs OR advanced features)

**Prevention:**
- Better qualification (sales should filter Phase 3+ customers)
- Set expectations upfront ("R2 for P&L only, not full accounting")
- Graceful offboarding (help migrate to Jurnal, stay friendly)

**Success:** Reduce mismatch churn from 15% → 5% via better sales qualification

---

## Retention ROI

**Scenario: Reduce Month 1 Churn from 30% → 20%**

```
100 customers signup
- 30% churn = 70 retained (baseline)
- 20% churn = 80 retained (improved)

Net gain: 10 additional customers
Revenue impact: 10 × Rp 50K × 12 months = Rp 6M ARR

Cost of retention efforts: Rp 1M (CS team time, discounts)
ROI: 6:1 (Rp 6M / Rp 1M)
```

**Takeaway:** Retention = highest ROI activity (6× return!)
