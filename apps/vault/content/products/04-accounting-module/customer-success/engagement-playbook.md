- Light touch (Day 1, Day 7, Day 21 only)

---

### Segment 2: Non-Tech (High-Touch)
**Profile:** Like Rika persona - need guidance

**Approach:**
- WhatsApp-first (daily check-ins if needed)

### Segment 3: Bundled (A1/E1 Existing Customers)
**Profile:** Already familiar with platform

**Approach:**
