## Trigger 1: Opens 2nd Outlet (Basic → Plus)

### How to Detect:

- Revenue doubles suddenly (2× outlets)
- Asks "Can R2 handle 2 locations?"

### Timing:
Reach out **Week 1 of 2nd outlet opening** (not before!)

### Upsell Script (WhatsApp):
```
Halo [Name]! Congrats on opening outlet ke-2!

Quick question: Gimana cara kamu track P&L untuk 2 outlets sekarang?

R2 Plus tier bisa:
 Consolidate P&L both outlets (1 dashboard)
 Compare performance (mana yang lebih profitable?)
 Cuma +Rp 25K/month (Rp 75K total)

Want to upgrade? I'll help setup in 10 min.
```

### Expected Response:
- "Yes, help setup" → Immediate upsell
- "Let me try manual first" → Follow up Week 3

### Upsell Rate: 50-60% (high intent - they NEED multi-location)

---

## Trigger 2: B2B Sales / Catering (Plus → Pro)

### How to Detect:
- Customer mentions "corporate catering orders"
- Asks "Can I create invoices in R2?"
- Revenue source includes B2B (not just retail)

### Upsell Script:
```
Noticed you're doing catering for corporates - congrats!

Are you using invoicing software? Or manual Word templates?

R2 Pro tier includes:
 R2e Invoicing module (professional invoices)
 Track payment status (overdue alerts)
 +Rp 25K/month only (Rp 100K total)

Save 2+ hours/month on manual invoicing. Interested?
```

### Expected Objection: "I already use [other invoicing tool]"
**Response:** "No problem - R2e is optional. But if you want all-in-one platform (accounting + invoicing), it's here."

### Upsell Rate: 30-40% (moderate - depends on B2B volume)

---

## Trigger 3: Inventory/Recipe Tracking (Add R2c)

### How to Detect:
- Customer asks "Can I track ingredient costs?"
- Business type: Bakery, food production (high COGS complexity)
- Asks "What's my recipe cost per serving?"

### Upsell Script:
```
You asked about recipe costing - great question!

R2 basic = P&L only (total COGS)
R2c COGS Calculator = Item-level tracking:
 Recipe costing (per burger/cake/etc.)
 Ingredient inventory tracking
 Waste analysis (berapa banyak ingredient expired)

+Rp 25K/month bundled with R2a.

Want 1-week free trial? I'll setup today.
```

### Upsell Rate: 20-30% (niche use case - bakeries, production-heavy F&B)

## Trigger 4: Tax Season (Add R2d Tax Module - Future)

### Timing: March-April (Indonesian tax season)

 +Rp 50K/month OR Rp 200K one-time annual

Want to join waitlist? Early-bird: Rp 30K/month.
```

### Expected Response: "I'll stick with accountant for now"
**Counter:** "No problem - R2d is for DIY tax filers. If you ever want to save Rp 1-3M accountant fee, we're here!"

---

## Trigger 5: High Growth (Revenue >Rp 200M/Month)

### How to Detect:
- Monthly revenue in R2 exceeds Rp 200M
- Customer mentions "hitting targets"
- Opens 3+ outlets

### Upsell Script:
```
[Name], your revenue hit Rp 200M/month - amazing growth! At this scale, have you considered:
- Full accounting software (Jurnal/Accurate)?
- Dedicated CFO/accountant?

We can help transition:
 Export all R2 data (3 years) to Jurnal
 Recommend accountant partners
 OR stay with R2 Pro + custom features

What's your plan for scaling?
```

**Goal:** Graceful offboarding OR enterprise contract

## Upsell Disqualifiers (Don't Push)

**Red Flags (Don't Upsell):**
- Customer health score <50 (fix retention FIRST)
- Recent complaint unresolved (timing wrong)
- Already expressed budget concerns
- Churn risk evident (save the customer, not upsell)

**Rule:** Retention > Upsell. Fix churn risk before pitching expansion.
