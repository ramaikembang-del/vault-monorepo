## Case Study 1: Amanda - "Hemat 10 Jam/Bulan dengan R2"

### Customer Profile
**Name:** Amanda (32 tahun)
**Business:** Kopi Kawan Café
**Locations:** 2 outlets (Jakarta Selatan)
**Revenue:** Rp 180M/month (combined)
**Staff:** 25 employees total

### Challenge (Before R2)
Amanda operated 2 café outlets and spent **10+ hours/month** on manual Excel accounting:
- Consolidating sales data from 2 POSes (Pawoon)
- Manually categorizing expenses (supplier invoices, staff salaries, rent)
- Creating separate P&L for each outlet
- Merging into consolidated view for ownership

**Pain:** "I was working ON the business (accounting) instead of IN the business (serving customers)."

**Time Cost:** 10 hours/month × Rp 50K/hour = **Rp 500K value lost**

### Solution (R2 Implementation)
- Week 1: Signed up for R2 Plus tier (Rp 75K/month for 2 locations)
- Week 2: Connected both Pawoon POSes (CSV auto-import)
- Week 3: Started entering expenses via WhatsApp (30 seconds per entry)
- Week 4: Generated first consolidated P&L (1-click)

**Setup Time:** 30 minutes total
**Monthly Effort:** Now only 1 hour/month (vs 10 hours before)

### Results
**Time Saved:** 9 hours/month = **Rp 450K value recovered**
**Cost:** Rp 75K/month (Plus tier)
**NET ROI:** Rp 375K/month savings = **500% ROI**

**Additional Benefits:**
- Discovered Outlet 2 was 15% less profitable (rent too high)
- Made data-driven decision to renegotiate rent
- Saved additional Rp 2M/year (rent reduction)

### Quote
> "Sebelum R2, saya habis 10 jam/bulan untuk Excel accounting. Sekarang cuma 1 jam. The time savings alone is worth 5× the price!"

## Case Study 2: Budi - "Bank Approve KUR Rp 100M Thanks to R2"

**Name:** Budi (45 tahun)
**Business:** Warung Nusantara
**Locations:** 1 outlet (Bandung), planning 2nd
**Revenue:** Rp 85M/month
**Staff:** 15 employees

### Challenge (Before R2)
Budi wanted to open a 2nd outlet and applied for **KUR (Kredit Usaha Rakyat) Rp 100M** from Bank BRI.

**Bank requirement:** SAK EMKM compliant financial statements (P&L, balance sheet)

**Budi's situation:**
- Using Excel for P&L (NOT SAK EMKM compliant)
- Bank rejected his first application
- Options:
 1. Hire accountant (Rp 5M one-time fee)
 2. Use Jurnal/Accurate (Rp 300-500K/month, complex setup)

**Problem:** Both options too expensive/complex for Mikro business

### Solution (R2 Implementation)
- Month 1: Switched from Excel to R2 Basic (Rp 50K/month)
- Month 2-3: Generated 3 months of SAK EMKM compliant P&L reports
- Month 4: Re-applied to Bank BRI with R2 reports
- **Result:** Loan APPROVED (Rp 100M)

**Cost:** Rp 200K total (4 months × Rp 50K) vs Rp 5M accountant fee

### Results
**Loan Approved:** Rp 100M (funded 2nd outlet expansion)
**Cost Savings:** Rp 4.8M (vs hiring accountant)
**Time to Approval:** 4 months (vs 6-8 months manual)

**Business Impact:**
- Opened 2nd outlet (Week 20)
- Revenue doubled to Rp 170M/month (both outlets)
- Now upgraded to R2 Plus tier (Rp 75K for 2 locations)

## Case Study 3: Rika - "Gampang Banget - Ibu Rumah Tangga Bisa Pakai"

### Customer Profile
**Name:** Rika (38 tahun)
**Business:** Bakso Enak
**Locations:** 1 outlet (Surabaya)
**Revenue:** Rp 55M/month
**Staff:** 10 employees
**Background:** Homemaker, NOT tech-savvy

### Challenge (Before R2)
Rika inherited the bakso restaurant from her father. She had ZERO accounting experience.

**Pain Points:**
- Excel formulas confusing ("What's VLOOKUP?")
- Afraid of making calculation errors
- Spent 8 hours/month just to get basic P&L
- Husband (also not tech-savvy) couldn't help

**Fear:** "I thought accounting software is for experts only. Too complicated for me."

### Solution (R2 Implementation)
**Day 1:** Signed up (Rika's daughter helped with registration)
**Day 2:** WhatsApp onboarding call with R2 support (15 min)
**Day 3-7:** Started entering expenses via WhatsApp voice notes
- "Spent Rp 300K on meat today" → Auto-logged to COGS

**Day 30:** Generated first P&L with 1-click

**Rika's reaction:** "Kok gampang banget? I thought I needed to learn software!"

### Results
**Time Spent:** 2 hours/month (vs 8 hours Excel)
**Error Rate:** 0% (auto-validated by R2) vs 20% manual errors in Excel
**Confidence:** 100% (knows P&L is accurate)

**Unexpected Benefit:**
- Discovered COGS was 45% (should be 30-35% for bakso)
- Found supplier overcharging (switched suppliers)
- Saved Rp 5M/year on COGS

### Quote
> "I'm NOT tech-savvy AT ALL. Tapi R2 super simple - tinggal WhatsApp expense, done. Even my mom could use it! Highly recommend for ibu-ibu yang gak ngerti Excel."
> — Rika, Bakso Enak

## Case Study 4: Rio - "R2 + Power BI = Complete Platform"

### Customer Profile
**Name:** Rio (28 tahun)
**Business:** Rio's Burger Joint
**Locations:** 1 outlet (Jakarta Barat)
**Revenue:** Rp 120M/month
**Existing Product:** A1 Power BI Template user (since Month 3)

### Challenge (Before R2)
Rio already used **A1 Power BI Template** for sales analytics (tracking daily sales, best-selling burgers, peak hours).

**Gap:** Analytics showed REVENUE trends, but NOT expense or profit trends.

**Pain:** "I knew sales were up 20%, but profit went down. Why? I had no expense tracking."

### Solution (R2 Bundled Implementation)
**Week 1:** Rio saw R2 launch and immediately signed up
**Bundle:** A1 + R2 = Rp 100K/month total (vs Rp 50K R2 standalone)
**Integration:** R2 auto-imported revenue from A1 POS data

**Now Rio has:**
- A1: Revenue analytics (sales trends, product mix)
- R2: Expense tracking + P&L
- **Complete picture:** Revenue + Expenses = Net Profit

### Results
**Insight Discovered:**
- Revenue up 20% (A1 showed this)
- But expenses up 30% (R2 revealed staffing overspend)
- Net profit actually DOWN 5%

**Action Taken:** Optimized staffing schedule (cut unnecessary overtime)
**Result:** Profit back up 15% (fixed the problem immediately)

**Bundle Value:** "A1 alone = blind spot. R2 alone = no context. Together = perfect."

### Quote
> "A1 tells me sales trends, R2 tells me profit trends. Together = complete F&B management platform. Best Rp 100K/month I spend."
> — Rio, Rio's Burger Joint
