## Gate 2A Decision Tree

### ALL 5 METRICS MET (Pass Gate 2A)
**Action:**
- [ ] Greenlight R2b-f development
- [ ] Scale marketing budget (Month 2: Rp 10M+)
- [ ] Hire full-time CS manager
- [ ] Plan Sprint 3 launch (R2b Cash Flow + R2c COGS)

**Celebration:**
- [ ] Team announcement (we did it!)
- [ ] Customer thank-you email (20+ early supporters)
- [ ] Publish success story (internal learnings)

---

### 3-4 METRICS MET (Conditional Pass)
**Action:**
- [ ] Analyze which metrics failed (why?)
- [ ] Pivot pricing OR messaging
- [ ] Re-validate Week 7-8 with adjusted approach
- [ ] Delay R2b-f by 1 sprint (focus on fixing gaps)

**Example Scenarios:**
- 18 customers (not 20) → Push 1 more week
- Churn 25% (not <20%) → Fix onboarding, retry
- NPS 50 (not 60+) → Address product gaps

---

### <3 METRICS MET (Fail Gate 2A)
**Action:**
- [ ] Cancel OR delay R2b-f (don't build more modules)
- [ ] Keep R2a for existing customers (don't shut down)
- [ ] Analyze root cause:
 - Pricing too high? (test Rp 30K/month)
 - Market not ready? (delay 6 months, focus on A1/E1)
 - Product not valuable? (pivot positioning)
- [ ] Decide: Pivot, Persevere, OR Kill

**Learnings:**
- [ ] Document what went wrong (for future products)
- [ ] Share learnings with team (avoid repeating mistakes)

---

## Post-Launch Activities (Week 7+)

**If Gate 2A Passed:**
- [ ] Month 2 marketing campaign (scale to Rp 10M budget)
- [ ] Upsell existing customers (Basic → Plus)
- [ ] Plan R2b/R2c development (Sprint 3)
- [ ] Hire CS team (full-time support)

**If Gate 2A Failed:**
- [ ] Retention focus (keep existing 15-19 customers happy)
- [ ] Analyze churn reasons (exit interviews)
- [ ] Test pricing elasticity (Rp 30K vs Rp 50K)
- [ ] Decide on R2 future (pivot vs kill)
