**Product:** R2 - Analytics Suite / Accounting Module
**Purpose:** Overcome common sales objections for Rp 50-100K/month accounting add-on

## Top 10 Objections & Responses

### 1. "Why not just use Jurnal/Accurate? They're established."

**Objection Type:** Competitive fear (incumbent advantage)

**Response Script (Indonesian):**
```
Betul, Jurnal/Accurate bagus untuk full accounting.
Tapi ada 3 bedanya:

1. **Price:** Mereka Rp 200-500K/month, kami Rp 50K (75% cheaper)
2. **Complexity:** Mereka untuk semua industri (complex), kami khusus F&B (simple)
3. **Integration:** Kamu already pakai [A1/E1] for analytics, R2 langsung integrate. Jurnal tidak.

Pertanyaan: Kamu butuh full accounting (tax filing, payroll, inventory) OR cuma P&L tracking?

→ If P&L only: "Kalau cuma P&L, overkill pakai Jurnal. R2 pas untuk kamu."
→ If full accounting: "Oke, R2 might not fit. But try 1 month free - kalau gak cocok no worries."
```

**Win Rate:** 60% (if customer only needs P&L, not full

 accounting)

### 2. "Excel is free - why pay Rp 50K/month?"

**Objection Type:** Price sensitivity (free alternative exists)

**Response Script (Indonesian):**
```
Benar Excel free. Tapi coba itung waktu kamu:

Excel accounting = 5 jam/bulan (input manual, formula errors, formatting)
Waktu kamu = Rp 50-100K/jam (owner rate)
Total cost Excel = Rp 250-500K/month (hidden cost: your time)

R2 = 30 menit/bulan (auto import revenue, quick expense entry, 1-click P&L)
Cost = Rp 50K/month
Time saved = 4.5 jam = Rp 225-450K value

Question: Kamu mau habis 5 jam or 30 minutes per bulan for same P&L result?

→ "Plus, Excel gak SAK EMKM compliant - bank gak terima for loan application."
```

**Visual Aid:** Show time tracking comparison table

| Method | Time/Month | Hard Cost | Time Value Cost | Total Cost |
|--------|------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Excel | 5 hours | Rp 0 | Rp 250-500K | **Rp 250-500K** |
| R2 | 30 min | Rp 50K | Rp 25-50K | **Rp 75-100K** |

**Savings:** Rp 150-400K/month + peace of mind

### 3. "I already have an accountant (Rp 500K-1M/month)."

**Objection Type:** Existing solution (switching cost)

**Response Script (Indonesian):**
```
Bagus! Akuntan profesional penting.

Question: Akuntan kamu provide real-time P&L?
→ Most answer: "No, monthly report end-of-month only."

Here's the use case: R2 for real-time (daily/weekly) self-service P&L.
Akuntan tetap pakai for month-end formal report + tax filing.

Bayangkan:
- Week 1: Check R2 - "Oh, expense terlalu tinggi minggu ini"
- Week 2-3: Adjust spending
- Week 4: Akuntan confirm with formal report

R2 = real-time control, Akuntan = monthly compliance.
Complement each other, bukan replace.

Mau coba 1 month free? Pakai bareng akuntan, lihat benefit nya.
```

**Win Rate:** 40% (harder sell - incumbent solution working)

### 4. "Rp 50K is too expensive for my small warung."

**Objection Type:** Genuine budget constraint

**Response Strategy:** Validate pain, offer alternative

**Response Script (Indonesian):**
```
Saya paham. Rp 50K bisa significant untuk warung kecil.

Question: Berapa omzet per bulan warung kamu?
→ If <Rp 20M/month: "Oke, makes sense. R2 might not fit yet."
→ If Rp 20-50M: "Actually, Rp 50K = 0.1-0.25% of revenue. Very affordable."

Alternative offer:
1. **Bundled with E1 Starter FREE trial:** Try E1 (analytics) 1 month free, R2 included. Total Rp 0 first month.
2. **Annual discount:** Pay yearly (Rp 600K → Rp 500K) = Rp 41K/month (17% savings)
3. **Referral discount:** Ajak 1 teman signup, kalian berdua dapat 1 month free

Which works for you?
```

**Qualification:** If truly can't afford Rp 50K, probably not ICP (Phase 0 survival, not Phase 1 growth)

---

### 5. "I don't trust storing financial data online (cloud security fear)."

**Objection Type:** Security/privacy concern

**Response Script (Indonesian):**
```
Valid concern! Data keuangan sensitive.

Here's our security:
1. **Bank-grade encryption:** Same tech as BCA/Mandiri mobile banking
2. **Indonesia-based servers:** Data never leave Indonesia (comply with local laws)
3. **Private dashboard:** Only you can see your data (even we can't access without permission)
4. **Backup daily:** Auto backup - kalau laptop rusak, data aman

Plus: Excel di laptop also at risk (laptop hilang/rusak = data gone).
Cloud actually safer (encrypted + backed up).

Mau lihat security certification docs? I can share.

→ If still skeptical: "Try 1 month - kalau gak comfortable with security, refund full."
```

**Trust Builder:** Offer security audit doc, show compliance badges (if any)

---

### 6. "I'll think about it" (= polite rejection)

**Objection Type:** Not urgent / low priority

**Response Strategy:** Create urgency without pressure

**Response Script (Indonesian):**
```
Sure, take your time!

Quick question though: What specifically do you want to think about?
→ Pricing? Features? Timing?

(Listen to real objection, address it)

Context: We're launching Sprint 2 week 3, jadi early-bird promo Rp 25K/month (50% off) ends week 4.
After that back to normal Rp 50K.

If price is concern: Lock in Rp 25K now (lifetime rate), cancel anytime kalau gak cocok.
Risk-free.

Mau reserve Rp 25K spot? I'll send link, proses 5 minutes.
```

**Urgency Tactics:**
- Limited-time pricing (early-bird)
- Limited slots ("First 20 customers only")
- FOMO ("5 warung di Jakarta already signed up this week")

---

### 7. "What if I need full accounting later? Do I have to switch?"

**Objection Type:** Future-proofing concern (upgrade path unclear)

**Response Script (Indonesian):**
```
Great question - you're thinking long-term!

Here's the upgrade path:

**Phase 1 (Now):** R2a P&L Analytics (Rp 50K/month) - Simple, 1-3 outlets
**Phase 2 (6-12 months):** + R2c COGS, R2f Invoicing (+ Rp 25-50K each) - As you grow
**Phase 3 (12-24 months):** Full accounting (Jurnal/Accurate) - When 5+ outlets

We designed R2 as stepping stone, bukan dead-end.
When you outgrow us, we help migrate to Jurnal (export data for free).

Question: Right now, kamu need P&L only OR full accounting?
→ If P&L only: "Perfect - R2 is right fit for kamu now."
```

**Migration Promise:** "We'll help export your data when ready to upgrade - no lock-in."

### 8. "I don't have time to learn new software."

**Objection Type:** Change resistance (learning curve fear)

**Response Script (Indonesian):**
```
Totally get it - busy running restaurant, no time for training.

Good news: R2 designed for zero training.

Setup process:
1. **5 minutes signup:** Name, restaurant, POS type
2. **10 minutes connect POS:** Upload 1 CSV export (we guide via WhatsApp)
3. **30 seconds expense entry:** WhatsApp message: "Spent Rp 500K on ingredients" → Done

No manual, no webinar, no complex setup.
If stuck, WhatsApp kami (response <1 hour).

Want proof? I'll setup your account now (screen share 10 min) - kamu just watch, gak perlu do anything.
If too complex, cancel immediately (no charge).
```

**Offer:** Free onboarding call (10-15 min) to remove friction

---

### 9. "My POS already has basic reports - why do I need this?"

**Objection Type:** Feature overlap (POS built-in reports sufficient)

**Response Script (Indonesian):**
```
Betul, Pawoon/Moka ada reports.

Tapi coba compare:

**POS reports (Pawoon/Moka):**
- Revenue only
- Expense tracking (manual Excel tetep)
- P&L (Revenue - Expenses)
- SAK EMKM compliant
- Multi-outlet consolidated

**R2 Accounting:**
- Revenue (auto-import from POS)
- Expense tracking (10 categories, 30-sec entry)
- P&L (Revenue - Expenses)
- SAK EMKM compliant
- Multi-outlet consolidated (Plus tier)

POS tells you "sales naik/turun."
R2 tells you "net profit naik/turun after expenses."

Which matters more to you?
```

**Demo:** Show side-by-side comparison (POS report vs R2 P&L)

### 10. "Can I try it free for 3 months? 1 month is too short."

**Objection Type:** Trial length negotiation

**Response Strategy:** Hold firm on 1 month, but offer reassurance

**Response Script (Indonesian):**
```
I understand - want to be sure before committing.

Here's why 1 month is enough:
- Week 1: Setup + first expense entries (see how easy it is)
- Week 2-3: Daily usage (build habit)
- Week 4: Generate first P&L (see value)

Kalau 1 month gak convinced, 3 months won't change that.

Alternative offers:
1. **1 month free + month 2 half-price** (Rp 25K only) - Total 2 months trial basically
2. **Money-back guarantee:** Pay month 2 (Rp 50K), kalau gak satisfied day 30-60, refund full
3. **Cancel anytime:** No contract - month 2 gak cocok, stop (gak perlu notice)

Which makes you comfortable?
```

**Firm Boundary:** Don't extend to 3 months free (devalues product, attracts tire-kickers)

## Objection Handling Framework

### Listen → Validate → Reframe → Close

**1. Listen:** Let customer fully explain objection (don't interrupt)

**2. Validate:** "I understand..." / "That's a valid concern..."

**3. Reframe:** Address root cause with data, testimonial, or alternative

**4. Close:** "Given that, are you ready to try 1 month free?"

---

## Red Flag Objections (Disqualify)

Some objections signal customer is NOT a fit. Don't waste time:

| Objection | Why Disqualify | Response |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| "I need English version" | Indonesian product | "Sorry, Bahasa only for now. Future maybe." |
| "Can I pay after 6 months?" | Cash flow issue | "Need payment upfront. Maybe not right time?" |
| "I want white-label resale" | Wrong use case | "Not available. Check back Q3 2025." |
| "Do you have API for custom integration?" | Too technical for Mikro | "Basic product only. Try Jurnal for advanced needs." |

---

## Objection Tracking (Sales Team)

Track objections weekly to improve messaging:

| Week | Top Objection | Response Used | Win Rate | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | "Excel free" | Time value calc | 70% | Works well, emphasize time savings |
| 2 | "Jurnal better" | F&B-specific + price | 50% | Need stronger differentiation |
| 3 | "Too expensive" | Bundle offer | 40% | Consider Rp 40K basic tier? |

**Monthly Review:** Adjust playbook based on what's working
