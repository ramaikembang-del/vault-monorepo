## Pricing Rationale

### Why Rp 50K/Month is Justified

**1. Time Savings Value**

| Activity | Excel Manual | R2 Automated | Time Saved |
|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Revenue tracking | 1 hour (manual entry from POS) | 5 min (auto-import) | 55 min |
| Expense categorization | 2 hours (receipts, categorize) | 15 min (WhatsApp entry) | 1.75 hours |
| P&L generation | 1.5 hours (formulas, formatting) | 1 min (1-click) | 1.48 hours |
| Error checking | 30 min (manual audit) | 0 min (auto-validated) | 30 min |
| **TOTAL** | **5 hours/month** | **30 min/month** | **4.5 hours** |

**Time value calculation:**
```
Owner hourly rate: Rp 50-100K/hour (based on Phase 1-2 Mikro revenue)
Time saved: 4.5 hours/month
Monthly value: 4.5 × Rp 50-100K = Rp 225-450K

R2 price: Rp 50K/month
NET SAVINGS: Rp 175-400K/month
ROI: 350-800%
```

**2. Accountant Replacement Value**

| Solution | Monthly Cost | What You Get | Limitations |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Full Accountant** | Rp 3-5M | Full service, tax filing, payroll | Expensive, month-end only |
| **Part-time Accountant** | Rp 500K-1M | Basic P&L, no real-time | Still manual, not scalable |
| **Accounting SW (Jurnal)** | Rp 200-500K | Full features | Complex, learning curve |
| **R2 (Us)** | **Rp 50K** | **P&L automation, real-time** | **No tax filing (yet)** |

**Positioning:** "98% cheaper than accountant, 75% cheaper than Jurnal, same P&L output"

---

**3. SAK EMKM Compliance Value**

**Indonesian Mikro Accounting Standard (SAK EMKM) Benefits:**
- Bank-ready financial statements (for loan applications)
- Government-compliant reporting (for licenses, permits)
- Investor-ready financials (for fundraising)

**Excel P&L:** NOT SAK EMKM compliant (banks reject)
**R2 P&L:** SAK EMKM compliant (banks accept)

**Value:** Unlocks Rp 50-500M loans (banks require compliant financials)

**Example:**
```
Customer needs Rp 100M bank loan for 2nd outlet expansion
Bank requires SAK EMKM P&L
→ Without R2: Hire accountant (Rp 5M one-time) OR use Jurnal (Rp 500K/month)
→ With R2: Rp 50K/month, done

Loan approval value vs R2 cost: 2000:1 ratio
```

## Pricing Tiers & Justification

### Tier 1: Basic (Rp 50K/month)

**For:** 1-outlet Mikro F&B
**Features:**
- Manual expense entry (10 categories)
- POS revenue import (CSV)
- Monthly P&L generation (SAK EMKM)
- Export PDF

**Justification:**
- Market research: Phase 1 Mikro can afford Rp 50-100K/month (1-2% of revenue)
- Competitor price: Rp 200-500K (we're 75-90% cheaper)
- Value delivered: Rp 225-450K time savings (4.5× ROI)

**Price sensitivity test (Week 1-2):**
- Try Rp 40K: If conversion rate jumps +50%, adopt Rp 40K
- Try Rp 60K: If conversion drops <10%, stay Rp 50K
- Current hypothesis: Rp 50K is sweet spot

---

### Tier 2: Plus (Rp 75K/month)

**For:** 2-3 outlet Mikro/Kecil F&B
**Additional Features:**
- Multi-location P&L
- Consolidated dashboard (all outlets)
- Location comparison

**Justification:**
```
2-3 outlets = 2-3× manual work in Excel
Time saved: 9-13.5 hours/month (vs 4.5 for single outlet)
Value: Rp 450-1.35M

Plus tier price: Rp 75K (+Rp 25K vs Basic)
ROI: Still 600-1800% (Rp 450-1.35M value / Rp 75K cost)
```

**Competitive gap:** Jurnal charges Rp 300-500K for multi-location (we're 75-85% cheaper)

---

### Tier 3: Pro (Rp 100K/month)

**For:** 3+ outlets OR B2B catering (invoicing needed)
**Additional Features:**
- All Plus features
- + R2e Invoicing module (invoice generation, tracking)

**Justification:**
- Invoice generation value: Rp 50-100K/month (admin time saved)
- Combined P&L + Invoicing: Rp 100K = 2 solutions in 1
- Standalone invoicing tools: Rp 200K+ (e.g., Zahir)

**Target:** Customers who outgrew Basic/Plus (upsell path)

---

## Competitive Pricing Analysis

### R2 vs Jurnal (Market Leader)

| Criterion | Jurnal | R2 | R2 Advantage |
|-----------|--------|---|--------------|
| **Price (Basic)** | Rp 200K/month | Rp 50K/month | **75% cheaper** |
| **F&B-Specific** | No (all industries) | Yes (F&B optimized) | Simpler, tailored |
| **Setup Time** | 2-4 hours (complex) | 15 min | 88% faster |
| **Learning Curve** | High (full accounting) | Low (10 expense categories only) | Easier adoption |
| **Integration with Analytics** | No | Yes (A1/E1) | Complete platform |
| **SAK EMKM Compliance** | Yes | Yes | Tie |
| **Tax Filing** | Yes | No (future R2d) | We lose here |

**Positioning:**
- "Jurnal for enterprises, R2 for Mikro F&B"
- "75% cheaper, 5× simpler, same P&L result"
- "Perfect for Phase 1-2, upgrade to Jurnal when Phase 3+"

---

### R2 vs Accurate

| Criterion | Accurate | R2 | R2 Advantage |
|-----------|----------|---|--------------|
| **Price** | Rp 300-500K/month | Rp 50K/month | **83-90% cheaper** |
| **Features** | Full accounting suite | P&L only | We're simpler (good for Mikro) |
| **Mobile Support** | Moderate | Excellent (WhatsApp entry) | Better UX |
| **Target** | SME (Phase 2-3) | Mikro (Phase 1-2) | Right-sized |

**Positioning:** "Accurate is overkill for 1-3 outlets. R2 is right-sized for Mikro."

---

### R2 vs Excel (Free)

| Criterion | Excel | R2 | R2 Advantage |
|-----------|-------|---|--------------|
| **Price** | Rp 0 | Rp 50K/month | We're paid |
| **Time Cost** | 5 hours/month | 30 min/month | **Save 4.5 hours = Rp 225-450K value** |
| **Error Risk** | High (manual formulas) | Low (auto-validated) | Peace of mind |
| **SAK EMKM** | No | Yes | Bank-ready |
| **Scalability** | Low (copy-paste chaos for 2+ outlets) | High (multi-location built-in) | Growth-friendly |

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Excel "savings": Rp 0 cost - Rp 250-450K time = -Rp 250-450K (negative value)
R2 value: Rp 225-450K time savings - Rp 50K cost = +Rp 175-400K (positive value)

NET: R2 is Rp 425-850K/month better than "free" Excel
```

## Price Objection Responses (Quick Ref)

### "Rp 50K is too expensive"

**Response:**
```
Time value calculation:
Your time = Rp 50-100K/hour
Time saved = 4.5 hours/month
Value = Rp 225-450K

Rp 50K cost → Rp 175-400K savings
ROI = 350-800%

Plus: SAK EMKM compliance = bank loan eligibility (Rp 50-500M value)
```

---

### "Why not Jurnal for Rp 200K? Only Rp 150K more."

**Response:**
```
Feature comparison:
Jurnal: 100+ features (tax, payroll, inventory, etc.) = complex
R2: 1 core feature (P&L) = simple

Question: Do you NEED tax filing + payroll now?
→ If yes: "Use Jurnal, R2 not right fit yet."
→ If no: "Then you're paying Rp 150K extra for features you don't use. Save it."

When 5+ outlets → upgrade to Jurnal. For now, R2 enough.
```

---

### "Excel is free - why pay?"

**Response:** See "R2 vs Excel" table above + time value calculation

## Pricing Elasticity Testing (Sprint 2)

**Week 1-2:** Test Rp 25K early-bird (50% off)
- Goal: 20+ signups (validates demand at lower price)

**Week 3-4:** Increase to Rp 50K
- Track conversion rate change
- If <30% drop: Rp 50K is sustainable
- If >50% drop: Consider Rp 40K permanent

**Week 5-6:** Test Rp 75K Plus tier
- Offer to 2-3 outlet customers
- Track uptake: Target 20-30% of Basic tier upgrades

**Learnings → Adjust pricing Month 2**

---

## Long-Term Pricing Strategy

### Year 1: Penetration Pricing (Current)

- Goal: Acquire 100-200 customers, prove value

### Year 2: Value-Based Pricing

### Year 3: Premium Positioning
- Rp 100K Basic (match Jurnal positioning)
- Add features: Tax filing (R2d), Invoicing (R2e)
- Justification: Now full accounting suite, not just P&L
