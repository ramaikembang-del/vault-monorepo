# Pre-Sale Validation Playbook - R2 Accounting Module
**Product:** R2 - Analytics Suite / Accounting Module
**Sprint:** Sprint 2
**Validation Target:** 20+ paying customers by Week 6
**Status:** Pre-Launch Validation Phase

---

## Validation Philosophy

**Goal:** Prove demand for accounting add-on EXISTS before building all 6 sub-products (R2a-f).

**Validation-First Approach:**
- Test market demand with MINIMAL product (MVP concept)
- Sell R2a (P&L Analytics) FIRST, not all 6 at once
- Validate standalone demand (vs Jurnal/Accurate) AND bundled demand (with A1/E1)
- Use validation results to decide: Build R2b-f? Pivot? Cancel?

---

## Two Validation Paths

### Path 1: Standalone Validation (Primary)
**Target:** Restaurants NOT using A1/E1 (cold market)
**Offer:** R2a P&L Analytics standalone @ Rp 50-100K/month
**Positioning:** "SAK EMKM P&L in 5 minutes/month, not 5 hours"

### Path 2: Bundled Validation (Secondary)
**Target:** Existing A1/E1 customers (warm market)
**Offer:** R2a bundled with A1 @ Rp 100K/month OR E1 @ Rp 250K total
**Positioning:** "Add accounting to your analytics dashboard"

---

## Validation Criteria (Gate 2A)

### Success Metrics (Week 6):
- **20+ paying customers** (standalone OR bundled)
- **Rp 1-2M MRR** (20 × Rp 50-100K)
- **<20% Month 1 churn** (proves value, not just trial curiosity)
- **80%+ expense entry at least 2×/month** (usage signal)
- **90%+ monthly P&L generation** (core value realized)
- **NPS 60+** (willing to recommend)

### Validation Decision Tree:
```
IF all 6 metrics met → Build R2b-f (expand accounting suite)
IF 4-5 metrics met → Pivot pricing/positioning, re-validate
IF <4 metrics met → Cancel/delay R2b-f, focus on A1/E1 growth
```

## Week-by-Week Validation Plan

### Week 1-2: Concept Testing (Pre-Build)

**Goal:** Validate INTEREST before building anything

**Activities:**
1. **Landing page test** (no product built yet)
 - Create simple landing page: "Accounting for Mikro F&B - Coming Soon"
 - Offer: Early-bird Rp 25K/month (50% off) for first 20 signups
 - CTA: "Reserve your spot - launching Week 3"
 - Target: 50+ email signups

2. **Direct outreach** (25 restaurant owners)
 - WhatsApp message: "We're building simple accounting for F&B. Want to be beta tester?"
 - Show mockup (screenshot from R2a docs)
 - Ask: "Would you pay Rp 50-100K/month for this?"
 - Target: 10+ "Yes, I'd pay" responses

3. **Competitor user interviews** (10 Jurnal/Accurate users)
 - Ask: "What's frustrating about [current tool]?"
 - Validate pain points: Too complex, expensive, not F&B-specific
 - Show R2a concept: "Would you switch for Rp 50-100K?"
 - Target: 5+ "Yes, I'd switch" responses

**Week 1-2 Pass Criteria:**
- 50+ landing page signups
- 10+ "I'd pay" commitments
- 5+ "I'd switch" from competitors

**If fail:** STOP - demand doesn't exist, focus on A1/E1 instead

---

### Week 3-4: MVP Beta Launch (Build Minimal R2a)

**Goal:** Get first 10 paying customers using REAL product

**Build Scope (MVP R2a):**
- Manual expense tracking (10 categories)
- POS revenue import (CSV only, not API)

- DON'T build: Tax filing, invoicing, advanced features

**Beta Pricing:**
- Rp 25K/month for first 20 customers (early-bird discount)
- Commitment: 3-month minimum (validates retention, not just trial)

**Recruitment:**
1. **Convert landing page signups** (Week 1-2)
 - Email: "R2a is ready - claim your Rp 25K/month spot"
 - Target: 20+ conversions from 50 signups (40% conversion)

2. **Bundled offer to A1 customers** (5-10 existing customers)
 - WhatsApp: "Free accounting add-on for 1 month, then Rp 25K"
 - Target: 5+ bundled customers

3. **Direct sales** (warm leads from Week 1-2)
 - Follow up "I'd pay" commitments
 - Offer: Beta access @ Rp 25K/month
 - Target: 5+ direct sales

**Week 3-4 Pass Criteria:**
- 10+ paying beta customers (any mix of standalone/bundled)
- 80%+ activate (enter first expense)
- No major bugs preventing P&L generation

**If fail:** Re-evaluate pricing OR product scope

---

### Week 5-6: Scale to 20+ Customers

**Pricing Adjustment:**
- Increase to Rp 50K/month for new customers (post-beta)
- Keep Rp 25K for beta cohort (lifetime discount)

**Acquisition Channels:**

 - Budget: Rp 2M (Rp 100K per customer target)
 - Creative: "Accounting for Mikro F&B - Rp 50K/month"
 - Target: 10+ signups

2. **Referrals from beta customers**
 - Offer: 1 month free for referrer + referee
 - Target: 5+ referrals

3. **POS provider partnerships** (Pawoon, Moka)
 - Co-marketing: "Now with accounting add-on"
 - Revenue share: 20% to POS provider
 - Target: 5+ partnership-driven customers

**Week 5-6 Pass Criteria:**
- 20+ total paying customers
- Rp 1-2M MRR
- <20% churn from Week 3-4 beta cohort
- 90%+ generate monthly P&L

**If pass:** Gate 2A PASSED → Build R2b-f

## Validation Tactics by Customer Segment

### Phase 1 Mikro (Primary Target)

**Persona:** Pak Budi (1-outlet warung owner)
**Pain:** Spends 5 hours/month on manual Excel accounting
**Validation Offer:** "Get your time back - Rp 50K/month for automated P&L"

**Validation Questions:**
1. "How much time do you spend on accounting each month?"
2. "Do you use Excel or hire an accountant?"
3. "Would you pay Rp 50K/month to save 5 hours?"

**Win Signal:** "Yes, Rp 50K is affordable - I spend more on phone credit"

---

### Phase 2 Kecil (Secondary Target)

**Persona:** Amanda (2-3 outlet café owner)
**Pain:** Inconsistent expense tracking across outlets
**Validation Offer:** "Consolidated P&L for all outlets - Rp 75K/month"

**Validation Questions:**
1. "How do you track expenses across multiple outlets?"
2. "Do you consolidate P&L monthly? How long does it take?"
3. "Would Rp 75K/month be worth it to save 10 hours/month?"

**Win Signal:** "I'd pay 2-3× more if it saves me time"

---

### A1/E1 Existing Customers (High-Intent)

**Persona:** Existing Power BI template OR Web Dashboard users
**Pain:** Have analytics but no accounting integration
**Validation Offer:** "Bundle accounting for Rp 25-50K extra/month"

**Validation Questions:**
1. "You track sales - do you track expenses too?"
2. "How do you generate monthly P&L now?"
3. "Would Rp 50K add-on be valuable?"

**Win Signal:** "That's a no-brainer - I already pay for analytics"

---

## Red Flags to Watch

### Demand Red Flags:
- <20% landing page sign-up → ad conversion (interest didn't convert)
- "I'll think about it" (not "yes, take my money")
- "Can I try it free for 3 months?" (price sensitivity too high)

### Product Red Flags:
- <50% activation rate (sign up but never use)
- Churn >20% Month 1 (product doesn't deliver value)
- "Where's the tax filing?" (scope mismatch - want full accounting)

### Competitive Red Flags:
- "Jurnal is only Rp 100K more and does 10× features"
- "Why not just use Excel?" (value prop weak)
- "My accountant charges Rp 500K and does everything" (positioning wrong)

---

## Validation Budget

**Total Budget (Week 1-6):** Rp 5M

| Item | Cost | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Landing page (ads) | Rp 1M | Week 1-2 interest validation |
| MVP development | Rp 0 | Use AI tools (low/no cost) |
| Instagram ads | Rp 2M | Week 5-6 customer acquisition |
| POS partnerships (revenue share) | Rp 500K | 20% × Rp 2.5M revenue |
| Beta incentives (discounts) | Rp 1.5M | Rp 25K discount × 20 customers × 3 months |

**Expected Return (If validation passes):**
- 20 customers × Rp 50K average × 3 months = Rp 3M
- **ROI:** -40% (investment phase, profit comes Month 4+)

---

## Validation Rollback Plan

**If Week 1-2 fails (no interest):**
- STOP immediately
- Refocus on A1/E1 growth (proven products)
- Revisit R2 in Sprint 3-4 after more A1/E1 traction

**If Week 3-4 fails (<10 customers):**
- Pivot pricing (try Rp 25K permanent, not temporary)
- OR pivot positioning ("Free with E1 Pro tier")
- Re-validate Week 5-6 with new approach

**If Week 5-6 fails (<20 customers):**
- Delay R2b-f (don't build more modules)
- Keep R2a for existing customers (don't shut down)
- Analyze: Was it pricing? Market readiness? Competition?

## Success Handoff to Session 2 (Marketing)

**If Gate 2A PASSES:**
1. Hand off 20+ validated customers to customer success team
2. Use validation learnings for marketing materials (Session 2)
