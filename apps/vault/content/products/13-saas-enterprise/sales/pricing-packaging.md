## ROI Calculation

### Customer Value Delivered

**Typical Savings (per year):**
- Operational efficiency: Rp 50-500M (reduce waste, optimize labor)
- Better decisions: Rp 20-100M (data-driven pricing, menu, etc.)
- Compliance: Rp 10-50M (avoid fines, audit costs)
- Time saved: 200-2,000 hours (reporting automation)

**Total Savings: Rp 80M - 650M/year**

### Payback Period

**Example: 200-location customer**
- Annual cost: Rp 1.4B
- Annual savings: Rp 200M
- Payback: 7 years (not attractive!)

**BUT:** Intangible benefits
- Real-time visibility (priceless for CEO)
- Compliance (risk mitigation)
- Competitive advantage

**Actual Decision:** Strategic investment, not pure ROI play

### Break-Even for PWBI

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Rp 200M (sales, implementation)
**Annual Revenue:** Rp 1.7B (300 locs)
**Gross Margin:** 70% = Rp 1.19B
**Payback:** 2 months (very attractive for PWBI!)

## Pricing FAQs

**Q: Why so expensive vs C1 (Rp 500M/year)?**
A: Dedicated infrastructure, 24/7 support, customization, multi-country. Enterprise customers have complex needs.

**Q: Can we pay per user instead of per location?**
A: No. Per-location is simpler (no user tracking). Unlimited users benefits you.

**Q: What if we add locations mid-year?**
A: Pro-rated addition. Example: Add 50 locations in Month 6 → 50 × Rp 4M × 6/12 = Rp 100M

**Q: What if we close locations?**
A: Annual commitment. No refunds for closed locations. But next year, pay for lower count.

**Q: Hidden fees?**
A: No. All-inclusive except custom dev (which is quoted upfront).
