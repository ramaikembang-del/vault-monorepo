# A4b Menu Engineer - Product Brief

**Product:** A4b - Menu Engineer
**Type:** Micro-SaaS
**Target:** SMB F&B (cafés, restaurants with 10-50 menu items)
**Pricing:** Rp 500K/year
**Launch:** Q1 2025

## Problem

F&B businesses keep loss-making menu items without knowing it. 70% of F&B owners can't answer "Which dishes are actually profitable?" They price based on gut-feel, lose Rp 10-20M/year on unprofitable items.

**Pain Points:**
- Don't know true COGS (ingredients + labor + overhead)
- Price too low → lose money on every sale
- Keep loss-makers on menu → bleeding cash
- No data to optimize menu mix

---

## Solution

AI-powered menu profitability analyzer that calculates true costs and recommends pricing/menu changes to maximize profit.

**How It Works:**
1. **Import Menu** from POS or manual entry
2. **Break Down Recipes** (ingredients + portions)
3. **AI Calculates True Cost** (COGS + labor allocation)
4. **See Profitability** by item (margin %, Rp per item)
5. **Get Recommendations** (price changes, discontinue, promote)
