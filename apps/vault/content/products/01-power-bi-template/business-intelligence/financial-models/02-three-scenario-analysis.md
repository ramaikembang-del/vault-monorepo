---

## Conservative Scenario (Baseline - Main Documentation)

**Use Case:** Official financial planning, risk-mitigated projections

### Assumptions

**Sales Volume:**
- Year 1: 150 customers (0.5% of 30K TAM)
- Year 2: 400 customers
- Year 3: 650 customers

**Pricing (UPDATED FOR MODULAR):**
- Tier 1 (Essentials): Rp 3.5-6M (avg Rp 4.75M modular)
- Tier 2 (Professional): Rp 7-12M (avg Rp 9.5M modular)
- Tier 3 (Enterprise): Rp 10-15M setup (avg Rp 12.5M modular)
- **Blended: Rp 4.7M average** (with modular pricing - 2.35x higher than old Rp 2M!)

**Channel Mix:**
- Partner referrals (Moka, Pawoon): 80% of sales
- Direct content marketing: 15%
- Word-of-mouth: 5%

**Key Constraints:**
- Partner push limited (120 sales vs 300 potential)
- No viral growth (K = 0)
- 2-person founding team execution capacity

### Revenue Breakdown

| Year | Sales | Revenue | Growth |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| Year 1 | 150 | Rp 300M | - |

## Realistic Scenario (Team of 3 Executing Well)

**Use Case:** Aggressive but achievable targets, internal team OKRs

### What Changes from Conservative

**1. Better Partner Leverage**
- Partner incentives: 20% commission (Rp 400-600K per sale)
- Drives 300 sales vs 120 from partners Year 1
- **Result: 350 total sales vs 150**

**2. Moderate Viral Growth**
- Affiliate program: 20% revenue share for referrals
- K = 0.5 (each customer brings 0.5 more over lifetime)
- Adds 50-100 referral sales annually

**3. Same Pricing**
- Still Rp 4.7M blended average (not testing higher pricing yet)
- Maintains market penetration focus

### Revenue Breakdown

| Year | Sales | Revenue | Growth | vs Conservative |
|------|-------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Year 1 | 350 | Rp 700M | - | +Rp 400M (+133%) |
| Year 2 | 900 | Rp 1,800M | +157% | +Rp 1,000M (+125%) |
| Year 3 | 1,300 | Rp 2,600M | +44% | +Rp 1,300M (+100%) |

### Team Requirements

**Can a team of 3 execute this?** **YES**

**Person 1 (Biz/Partnerships):**
- 350 sales/year = 1 sale per day average = 2-3 hours daily
- Partner management: 3 POS partnerships = 1 day/week
- **Doable**

**Bottleneck:** Not tech or support - it's marketing reach to 350 buyers

**Quick Wins to Activate:**
1. Launch affiliate program (Month 2)
2. Partner incentives: 20% commission to Moka/Pawoon (Month 1)
3. Double content output: 2 YouTube videos/week -> 4/week

---

## Aggressive Scenario (Everything Goes Right)

**Use Case:** Investor TAM potential, extreme upside case

### What Changes from Realistic

**1. Premium Pricing**
- Test Rp 6M for Tier 1 (vs Rp 4.7M avg)
- Tier 2: Rp 9M, Tier 3: Rp 18M
- **Rationale:** Consultants charge Rp 15-30M, we're still 5-10x cheaper
- Customer saves 200 hours @ Rp 100K/hr = Rp 10M value, pays Rp 3M = 6x ROI

**2. Geographic Expansion**
- Malaysia: +30% TAM (10M population, similar market)
- Thailand: +150% TAM (70M population, Year 3)
- **Adds 30-50% more sales**

**3. White-Label Partnerships**
- POS companies resell to agencies
- **Adds 100-200 sales/year**

**4. Strong Viral Growth**
- K = 1.0-1.5 (affiliate network scales to 100 affiliates)
- Each affiliate refers 2 customers/year = 200 sales

### Revenue Breakdown

| Year | Sales | Revenue | Growth | vs Conservative |
|------|-------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Year 1 | 500 | Rp 1,500M | - | +Rp 1,200M (+400%) |
| Year 2 | 1,500 | Rp 4,500M | +200% | +Rp 3,700M (+463%) |
| Year 3 | 3,000 | Rp 9,000M | +100% | +Rp 7,700M (+592%) |

### Team Requirements

**Can a team of 3 execute this?**  **NO - Need 5-10 people by Year 2**

**Required Scaling:**
- Sales team: 3-5 people (100-150 customers/person/year)
- Marketing: 2 people (geographic expansion, content scaling)
- Ops/CS: 2-3 people (500+ customers = support load)

**When to Scale:** If hitting Realistic targets by Month 6, hire aggressively for Aggressive scenario

## 3-Phase Pricing Strategy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pricing Evolution Over Time:** Prices shown in scenarios above are Phase 1 (2026) launch rates. Market pricing will increase in Phase 2 (2027) and Phase 3 (2028).

### Phase 1: Launch (2026) - First 100 Customers

| Tier | Price | ROI | Strategy |
|------|-------|-----|----------|
| Tier 1 | Rp 3.5-6M | 10.9x | Land grab, fast adoption |
| Tier 2 | Rp 7-12M | 48.2x | Lead with this tier |
| Tier 3 | Rp 10-15M | 52.9x | Premium positioning |

**Goal:** 150 customers, Rp 300M revenue (Conservative scenario)
**Focus:** Market education, case study collection, validate-first

---

### Phase 2: Proven (2027) - 100-300 Customers

| Tier | Price | ROI | Trigger Point |
|------|-------|-----|---------------|
| Tier 1 | Rp 5-9M (+50%) | 7-15x | 100 customers, NPS 70+, 5+ case studies |
| Tier 2 | Rp 10-18M (+50%) | 25-45x | Strong word-of-mouth, partner referrals live |
| Tier 3 | Rp 30-40M (+50%) | 18-24x | Market understands ROI value |

**Goal:** 400 customers (cumulative), Rp 700M-1B revenue
**Focus:** Partner leverage (Moka/Pawoon), content marketing, referral program

**Grandfather:** First 100 customers keep Phase 1 pricing (loyalty reward)

---

### Phase 3: Mature (2028) - 300+ Customers

| Tier | Price | ROI | Trigger Point |
|------|-------|-----|---------------|
| Tier 1 | Rp 8-12M (+150%) | 6-9x | Competitors entering, market mature |
| Tier 2 | Rp 15-25M (+150%) | 30-50x | Industry case studies abundant |
| Tier 3 | Rp 50-80M (+250%) | 12-19x | Full SaaS available (C1-C4) for upsell |

**Goal:** 650 customers (cumulative), Rp 1.3-2.6B revenue
**Focus:** Upselling to Full SaaS, enterprise sales team, geographic expansion

---

### Why Phased (Not Immediate Increase)?

1. **Market education time:** Indonesian F&B doesn't yet understand BI tool value
2. **Case study moat:** 100 evangelists at 80x ROI > higher prices with fewer customers
3. **Competitive barrier:** Price increases create switching costs (grandfathered customers stay)
4. **Sales optimization:** Learn optimal messaging/channels before scaling


## Recommendation

**For Financial Planning:** Use **Conservative** (Rp 300M -> Rp 1,300M)
**For Team Targets:** Use **Realistic** (Rp 700M -> Rp 2,600M)
**For Investor Pitches:** Show all three, emphasize Realistic as achievable

**Quarterly Review:**
- If tracking Conservative: Execute quick wins
- If tracking Realistic: Execute medium-term levers
- If tracking Aggressive: Scale team, consider fundraising
