| Tier | Price (One-Time) | Target Persona | Key Value |
|------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Tier 1: Essentials** | **Rp 3.5M - 6M** | **Dimas** (Single Outlet) | 10x faster than Excel, 90% success rate vs DIY. |
| **Tier 2: Professional** | **Rp 7M - 12M** | **Amanda** (2-3 Outlets) | Multi-outlet consolidation, "Aha!" insights on underperformance. |
| **Tier 3: Enterprise** | **Rp 10M - 15M** | **Andi** (4-15 Outlets) | White-glove managed setup, 1/10th cost of hiring analyst. |

> [!NOTE]
> All prices are **One-Time Fees**. Ongoing support, monthly maintenance, and deep customization are sold separately as **Product 02 (Template Support)**.
