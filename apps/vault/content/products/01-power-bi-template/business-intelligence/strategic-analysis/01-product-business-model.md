## 10. Pricing Strategy & Value Capture

### A. Intentional Underpricing Strategy (Year 1)

**We are capturing only 1-6% of value created.**
- Tier 1: Rp 49M value ? Price Rp 4.5M (9% capture)
- Tier 2: Rp 458M value ? Price Rp 9.5M (2% capture)
- Tier 3: Rp 661M value ? Price Rp 12.5M (1.8% capture)

**Why this is strategic (not accidental):**
1. **Land Grab:** Capturing 100 evangelists at 10-50× ROI creates an impenetrable moat.
2. **Market Education:** F&B SMEs are skeptical; extreme ROI removes friction.
3. **Grandfathering:** Price increases in Year 2-3 create massive switching costs ("I have the cheap legacy rate").

### B. "Lead with Tier 2" Strategy

**Sales Focus: 70% Tier 2 | 20% Tier 1 | 10% Tier 3**

**Why Tier 2 is the Lead Product:**
1. **Highest ROI (48.2×):** The "Multi-outlet Discovery Moment" (seeing which outlet steals money) is the most powerful sales hook.
2. **Best Unit Economics:** Rp 7.8M gross profit per sale vs Rp 3.8M for Tier 1.
3. **Founder Efficiency:** Earns Rp 2.6M/hour of founder time (vs Rp 1.8M/hr for Tier 1).
4. **Market Size:** 15,000 restaurants in this segment (50-60% of SAM).

**Recommendation:** All outbound sales scripts should pitch Tier 2 first. Tier 1 is a down-sell for budget-constrained, Tier 3 is an up-sell for large chains.
