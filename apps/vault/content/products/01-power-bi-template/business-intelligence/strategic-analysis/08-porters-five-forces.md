 - Hard to replicate without real customers

### Likelihood of New Entrants

## 2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: LOW (1.5/5)

### Key Suppliers

#### 1. Microsoft (Power BI Platform)
**Power:** MODERATE
- We depend on Power BI Desktop (free tier)
- Microsoft could change pricing/terms
- But:
 - Desktop is free for 10+ years (unlikely to change)
 - We can migrate to Metabase/Superset if needed
 - Multiple BI platforms available (Tableau, Looker, etc.)

**Switching Cost:** MODERATE (3-6 months to rebuild on new platform)

#### 2. POS System Providers (Data Sources)
**Power:** LOW
- Moka, Pawoon, Qasir all export CSV (standard format)
- We don't depend on any single POS
- Customer owns their data

**Switching Cost:** LOW (CSV is universal)

#### 3. Freelance Developers (If We Hire)
**Power:** LOW
- Abundant Power BI freelancers in Indonesia
- Can hire from Upwork, Sribulancer, Projects.co.id
- Not dependent on any single developer

**Switching Cost:** LOW (Power BI skills are common)

### Supplier Concentration

- **Microsoft:** 1 supplier (Power BI platform) - but free tier
- **POS Systems:** 10+ options (low concentration)
- **Developers:** 100+ freelancers (low concentration)

### Our Position

 **Strong:** We are not dependent on any single supplier
 **Flexible:** Can switch platforms if Microsoft changes terms
 **Low Cost:** Most suppliers are free or commodity (freelancers)

**Threat Level:** LOW (1.5/5)
**Mitigation:** Maintain platform flexibility (E1 Web Dashboard as backup)
