## Executive Summary

### Product Overview

Product 01 is a **modular Power BI analytics ecosystem** designed specifically for Indonesian F&B businesses. Unlike standalone BI templates that customers struggle to implement, A1 provides a complete **Excel-to-Dashboard bundle** that ensures customer success through:

1. **Pre-built Excel templates** (F&B-specific data entry)
2. **Power BI dashboards** (30-150 metrics based on tier)
3. **Google Sheets integration** (multi-user collaboration)
4. **One-click refresh automation** (zero technical complexity)
5. **Bahasa Indonesia training videos** (5-15 hours of content)

### Strategic Positioning

**Value Proposition:**
"From spreadsheet chaos to data-driven decisions in 30 minutes - without hiring an analyst or learning Power BI."

**Market Position:**
- **Below:** Enterprise BI (Tableau, Qlik) - Rp 240K-1.1M/month, too expensive
- **Above:** Manual Excel - Free but 8+ hours/week time waste
- **Our Sweet Spot:** One-time purchase (Rp 3.5-19.8M), zero recurring cost for Tier 1-2

 - 50% of TAM = 50,000 businesses
 - Source: POS vendor data (Moka 30K + Pawoon 20K + Qasir 10K = 60K installed base)

2. **Revenue >Rp 250M/year** (can afford Rp 3.5-19.8M one-time)
 - 70% of digital-ready = 35,000 businesses
 - Source: BPS revenue distribution for F&B UMKM

3. **5+ Staff** (needs analytics, not solo owner)
 - 75% of viable revenue = 26,250 businesses
 - Source: Labor force survey

### 1.3 SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

**Year 1-3 Customer Acquisition:**

| Year | New Customers | Cumulative | % of SAM (20K) | Avg Customer Value | Revenue |
|------|--------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Year 1** | 100 | 100 | 0.5% | Rp 4.7M | Rp 470M |
| **Year 2** | 150 | 250 | 1.25% | Rp 4.7M (new) + upsells | Rp 1.1B |
| **Year 3** | 200 | 450 | 2.25% | Rp 4.7M (new) + upsells | Rp 2B |

**Tier Mix Evolution:**

| Year | Tier 1 (T1) | Tier 2 (T2) | Tier 3 (T3) | Avg Price | MRR Component |
|------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Year 1** | 70% (70 customers) | 25% (25 customers) | 5% (5 customers) | Rp 4.7M | Rp 2M total |
| **Year 2** | 60% | 30% | 10% (25 total) | Rp 5.2M | Rp 10M total |
| **Year 3** | 50% | 35% | 15% (67 total) | Rp 5.8M | Rp 27M total |

**Why SOM is Conservative (0.5% Year 1):**

1. **Founder-led sales** (limited capacity: 50-60 deals/year)
2. **New product** (no brand awareness, building trust)
3. **Education required** (F&B owners don't know Power BI exists)
4. **Competitive Excel inertia** (free, familiar, "good enough")

**Path to 2.25% penetration (Year 3):**
- Year 1: Founder + warm network
- Year 2: 2 salespeople + referral program + POS partnerships
- Year 3: 3 salespeople + proven case studies + LinkedIn ads

### 1.4 Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**

| Competitor | Product | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|------------|---------|-------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Generic BI Templates** (Envato, Gumroad) | Power BI .pbix files | Rp 500K-2M | Cheap, instant download | 60% fail to implement, no F&B specificity, no Excel templates | Excel bundle, F&B metrics, 92% success rate |
| **Moka Analytics** | Built-in POS reports | Free (with POS) | Free, integrated | Only 5 basic metrics, limited customization, vendor lock-in | 30-150 metrics, works with ANY POS, deeper insights |
| **BukuWarung Analytics** | Mobile app analytics | Free (500K users) | Free, mobile-first | Consumer-focused (warung), not for multi-outlet | Enterprise features, multi-outlet, strategic metrics |
| **Manual Excel** | Spreadsheets | Free | Familiar, flexible | 4-8 hours/week time waste, error-prone, not scalable | Automated, real-time (with refresh), scalable |

**Indirect Competitors:**

| Alternative | Cost | Why Customers Choose It | How We Win |
|-------------|------|------------------------|------------|
| **Hire Junior Analyst** | Rp 5-8M/month (Rp 60-96M/year) | Dedicated resource, custom analysis | 95% cheaper (Rp 4.7M one-time), no HR burden, F&B expertise |

**Competitive Moats:**

1. **F&B Specificity** (100 pre-built metrics vs generic templates)
2. **Excel Ecosystem** (competitors only sell .pbix, we sell complete workflow)
3. **Bahasa Indonesia Content** (5-15 hours of training videos, competitors are English-only)
4. **Proven Implementation** (92% success rate vs 40% industry avg)
5. **First-Mover** (no F&B-specific Power BI bundle in Indonesian market yet)

## Part 6: Risk Mitigation

### 6.1 Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Low Conversion (<40% discovery -> sale)**

Causes:
- Price too high
- Solution not differentiated enough
- Trust barrier (new vendor)

Mitigation:
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- Beta customer testimonials (video)
- Free 30-min "data audit" consultation (lead magnet)

---

**Risk 2: High Setup Failure (>20%)**

Causes:
- Customers can't provide clean data
- Excel templates too complex
- Power BI technical issues

Mitigation:
- Beta validated 92% success (8% tolerance OK)
- Proactive onboarding support (WhatsApp <4h response)
- "Done-for-you" option (upgrade to T3 mid-flight)

---

**Risk 3: Churn >30% Annual**

Causes:
- One-time purchase = no recurring revenue lock-in
- Low perceived value after setup
- Competitor undercuts on price

Mitigation:
- Adoption-focused onboarding (usage = stickiness)
- Upgrade path (T1 -> T2 -> T3, keep customers growing)
- Optional Product 02 support (create recurring relationship)

---

**Risk 4: Market Saturation (Year 3+)**

Causes:
- 20K SAM penetrated at 10% = 2,000 customers (ceiling)
- Diminishing returns on sales effort

Mitigation:
- Expand TAM (Product 03: Web Dashboard Lite for smaller businesses)
- Increase ACV (upsell existing customers, add modules)
- Geographic expansion (SEA markets: Philippines, Vietnam)
