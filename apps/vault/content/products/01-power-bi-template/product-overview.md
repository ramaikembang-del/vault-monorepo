## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Pre-Sale Validation Philosophy: "Sell-First, Build-Second"

> **Validate-First:** Pre-sell before building

**Execution Approach (Week -1, Week 0, Week 1):**
- **Week -1:** Legal & infrastructure foundation (ToS, Midtrans, Google Drive, email automation)
- **Week 0:** Pre-sale validation (15-20 conversations, 3+ commits OR 2+ deposits target)
- **Week 1 (Days 1-10):** Build ONLY if Week 0 passes validation gate

**Decision Gates:**
- **PASS:** 3+ verbal commits OR 2+ deposits Proceed to build
- **PARTIAL:** 2 commits, positive feedback Adjust pricing, extend 1 week
- **FAIL:** <2 commits, lukewarm feedback Pivot or pause

**Why This Works:** Market validation BEFORE investment = lower risk, confirmed demand, validated pricing

**This product follows validate-first, then build-second approach.**

---

### Sales Process (7-14 Day Cycle)

**Stage 1: Lead Qualified (Day 1-2)**
- BANT qualification (5-10 min call)

**Stage 4: Closed Onboarding (Day 11-14)**

- Payment received Trigger delivery SOP
- Hand off to ops team (Tier 2/3) or send files (Tier 1)

**Conversion Rate:** 40% (demo purchase)

---

### Primary Lead Channels (Sprint 1-2)

#### 1. Warm Network (Week 1-2 Priority)
**Goal:** 10-15 demos booked

**WhatsApp Template:**
```
Halo [Name]! Gimana kabarnya?

Aku lg bangun analytics dashboard khusus buat F&B (restoran/cafe).
Bisa bantu track revenue, staff performance, customer retention-otomatis di Power BI.

Boleh 30 menit demo? Mau lihat cocok gak buat [restaurant name]?

Gratis konsul, no strings attached
```

**Expected:** 50 messages -> 20 responses -> 12 demos -> 5 closed

---

#### 2. F&B Community Groups (Week 2-4)
**Goal:** 5-10 demos from community trust

**Platforms:**
- WhatsApp Groups: "Paguyuban Pemilik Restoran Jakarta"
- Facebook Groups: "Indonesian F&B Entrepreneurs"
- LinkedIn: "Hospitality Indonesia" group

**Value-First Post Example:**
```
Teman-teman owner restoran/cafe, mau sharing insight nih:

Banyak yang nanya ke aku: "Kenapa revenue naik tapi profit turun?"

Biasanya ada 3 silent killers:
1. Food cost naik pelan-pelan (dari 28% -> 35% tanpa sadar)
2. Staff underperformers yang "nyantai" (20% staff ngabisin 40% labor cost)
3. Customer churn (kehilangan 10-15 regulars per bulan without realizing)

Aku bikin dashboard Power BI yang track 75 metrics buat catch masalah ini sebelum terlambat.

Kalau ada yang mau lihat demo (30 menit, gratis), DM aja. Happy to help!
```

**Rule:** Share insights first, offer help second (not "BUY NOW")

---

### Competitive Positioning

**vs Excel:**
> "Excel is free, but it costs you 4 hours/week. At Rp 100K/hour (your time value), that's Rp 20M/year wasted. Our dashboard: Rp 3.5-6M one-time, saves 200+ hours/year. Pays for itself in Month 1."

**vs POS Built-in Reports (Pawoon, Moka, Qasir):**
> "POS reports answer 'what happened?' (sales, bestsellers). We answer 'why did it happen and what should I do?' (staff efficiency, customer segmentation, profitability by outlet)."

**vs Hiring BI Consultant (Rp 20-50M):**
> "Consultant: Rp 20-50M, 2-4 weeks, risky quality. Us: Tier 1 Rp 3.5-6M / Tier 2 Rp 7-12M / Tier 3 Rp 10-15M, live in 3 hours to 5 days, proven template. You get 80% of consultant quality for 20% of the cost and 10% of the time."

5. **Gue Udah Punya Excel** - Migration friction
6. **Gue Mau Kayak Franchise Besar** - Aspiration
7. **Gue Nggak Percaya Data** - Skepticism
8. **Gue Nggak Punya Waktu Belajar** - Time scarcity
9. **Gue Takut Salah** - Risk aversion
10. **Stakeholder Buy-in** - Family business dynamics

**Why This Matters:**
- Resonates emotionally (not just functionally)
- Hard to copy (requires cultural fluency)
- Creates brand loyalty

### 4. **Gamification = Retention**

**Standard SaaS Retention:** 50%/year
**Our Retention (with gamification):** 85%/year

**Engagement Metrics:**
- 40% DAU/MAU (daily active / monthly active)
- 14-day average streak
- NPS: 70+ (Tier 1), 75+ (Tier 2), 80+ (Tier 3)

**Why It Works:**
- Transforms checking dashboard from "boring chore" to "exciting game"
- Daily streak = habit formation (loss aversion psychology)
- Business Health Score = sense of progress
- 52 achievements = guided learning path

## What's NOT Included (Intentional Limitations)

### By Design - Upgrade Path to Full SaaS

**Real-Time Data Refresh**
- Template = daily manual refresh (1 minute)
- Upgrade Path: Full SaaS Pro (C2) for hourly auto-refresh

**Multi-Outlet Consolidated View (Advanced)**
- Template = basic multi-outlet via Outlet-Summary.xlsx
- Upgrade Path: Full SaaS Pro (C2) for full multi-outlet (3+ outlets)

**Mobile App**
- Template = desktop Power BI only
- Upgrade Path: Full SaaS Basic (C1) for mobile access

**Team Collaboration (Multi-User)**
- Template = single Power BI file
- Upgrade Path: Full SaaS Pro (C2) for team collaboration

**Accounting Module Integration**
- Template = analytics only (not accounting)
- Upgrade Path: Add R2 (Accounting Module) separately

## Gate-Based Execution Framework

### Phased Build Approach (Demand-Driven)

**Philosophy:** Build incrementally, validate at each gate, proceed only if demand confirmed.

**Gate Structure:**

| Gate | Timing | Criteria | Pass -> Action | Fail -> Action |
|------|--------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Week 0** | Pre-build | 3+ commits OR 2+ deposits | Build T1-Basic | Pivot messaging/pricing |
| **Gate 1A** | End Week 2 | 5+ sales, Rp 15M+ revenue | Build T1-Standard/Plus | Extend 1 week OR analyze why |
| **Gate 1B** | End Month 1 | 15+ customers, Rp 50M+ revenue | Build T2 Professional | Continue T1 focus |
| **Gate 2** | End Month 2 | 25+ customers, Rp 100M+ revenue | Build T3 Strategic | Optimize T1/T2 |

**Why Gates Matter:**
- Prevents building unwanted features
- Validates demand before investing development effort
- Provides clear go/no-go decision points
- Reduces risk by phasing investment

**12-Week Execution Timeline:**
- **Week -1, Week 0:** Pre-work + Validation
- **Week 1 (Days 1-10):** T1-Basic build & launch
- **Week 2:** Post-launch operations, hit Gate 1A
- **Week 3-4:** T1-Standard/Plus (if Gate 1A passed)
- **Week 5-8:** T2 Professional (if Gate 1B passed)
- **Week 9-12:** T3 Strategic (if Gate 2 passed)

**See:** [[products/01-power-bi-template/product-strategy/roadmap/02-week-0-1-execution|09-week-0-1-execution-plan.md|09-week-0-1-execution-plan.md]] for detailed Week 0-1 execution.

## Key Learnings from the Study

### 1. **This is NOT a Power BI template business**

It's a **complete data ecosystem business** with:
- Pre-formatted input layer (Excel templates) -> **THE KEY**
- Processing layer (Power BI automation)
- Output layer (Professional dashboards)

The Excel templates are the competitive moat they eliminate the #1 reason competitors fail (data format confusion).

---

### 2. **Modular pricing is strategic brilliance**

**Old Problem:** "I need 50 metrics, why pay for 150?"

**New Solution:** Pay for what you need, add modules as you grow

**Business Impact:**
- Lower entry barrier (Rp 3.5M vs Rp 10-15M)
- Clear upsell path (add modules)
- Customer control = higher satisfaction

---

### 3. **Indonesian cultural positioning is the secret**

**Generic Positioning:** "Power BI analytics for restaurants"
**Cultural Positioning:** "Excel + Power BI = Kacamata buat Excel

Addressing **10 cultural angles** (modal tipis, gaptek, WiFi mati, etc.) creates:
- Emotional resonance (not just functional value)
- Brand loyalty (hard to copy without cultural fluency)
- Word-of-mouth growth (relatable messaging)

---

### 4. **Gamification drives retention**

**85% retention vs 50% industry standard** is NOT luck—it's by design:

- Business Health Score (0-100) = progress visibility
- 52 achievements = guided learning
- Daily streaks = habit formation (loss aversion)
- 10 levels = RPG-style progression

**Result:** Checking dashboard becomes fun, not a chore.

---

### 5. **Validate-First philosophy reduces risk**

**Traditional Approach:**
1. Build product (6 months)
2. Launch to market
3. Hope customers show up

**This Product's Approach:**
1. Create mockups (1 week)
2. Have 15-20 conversations (2 weeks)
3. Get 3-5 commitments + deposits (Week 3)
4. **THEN** build the product (Week 4+)

**Result:** Market validation BEFORE investment = lower risk.

---

### 6. **Tier 2 is the sweet spot for founder-led sales**

**Unit Economics Comparison:**
- Tier 1: Rp 1.8M profit/hour (high margin, low value)
- Tier 2: **Rp 2M profit/hour** (best balance)
- Tier 3: Rp 290K profit/hour (high value, labor-intensive)

**Recommendation:** Focus on Tier 2 for Sprint 1-3, use Tier 1 as entry point, use Tier 3 for upsell.

---

## Recommendations (Based on Study)

### For Sprint 1-3 Execution (Next 3 Months)

**1. Lead with Tier 2 in Sales Conversations**
- Highest profit per hour (Rp 2M/hour)
- One-and-done (no ongoing commitment)
- Easiest to sell (sweet spot pricing)

**2. Use Tier 1 as Entry Point**
- For price-sensitive customers
- Let them self-qualify ("I can DIY")
- 40% will upgrade to Tier 2 anyway

**3. Position Tier 3 as Upsell**
- Don't lead with it (labor-intensive)
- Offer after Tier 1/2 customers outgrow
- Cap hours to stay profitable (1 customization/month, not 2)

---

### For Marketing & Positioning

**4. Always Lead with "Complete Ecosystem," NOT "Power BI Template"**
- Emphasize 5 components (dashboard + Excel + Sheets + automation + videos)
- Differentiation = Excel templates (eliminate data format confusion)
- Messaging: "30-minute time-to-insight" (not "8 hours setup")

**5. Use Cultural Positioning in ALL Sales Conversations**
- "Excel + Power BI = Kacamata buat Excel"
- Address 10 cultural angles (modal tipis, WiFi mati, etc.)
- Use Bahasa Indonesia (not corporate English)

**6. Leverage Gamification in Demos**
- Show Business Health Score prominently
- Demonstrate achievement system
- Create "wow moment" with streak mechanics

---

### For Product Development

**7. Modular Framework = Future-Proof**
- Don't lock into fixed pricing
- Let customers choose modules
- Create clear upgrade path (T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> Full SaaS)

**8. Excel Templates Are the Moat**
- Invest in making them AMAZING
- Pre-fill customer data (Tier 2/3)
- White-label branding (Tier 3)
- This is why we win vs competitors

**9. Cap Tier 3 Hours to Stay Profitable**
- Current: 2 customizations/month = -Rp 350K/month loss
- Fix: 1 customization/month OR quarterly calls (not monthly)
- Alternative: Upsell to Full SaaS (Rp 300K-8M/month)
