## File 2: sales/objection-handling.md

**Key New Objections:**

**Objection 1: "I already bought a Power BI template and it didn't work"**
Response:
"That's exactly why we built this differently. Other templates give you .pbix file only - no guidance on data format. We include pre-formatted Excel templates. You literally fill in the blanks. 60% of people who bought other templates failed because of data format confusion. Our success rate is 90% because Excel templates solve that."

**Objection 2: "Why is this more expensive than other templates?"**
Response:
"Actually, it's not. Other templates: Rp 2M for .pbix file only. Us: Rp 2M for complete bundle - Power BI + 4 Excel templates + Google Sheets + automation + videos. If you bought all those separately, Rp 5M. So you're getting 60% discount. Plus, our time-to-insight is 30 minutes vs their 8 hours. Time = money."

**Objection 3: "My staff won't use Power BI"**
Response:
"Correct! That's why they don't touch Power BI. Staff use Excel templates (familiar, 2 min/day). You're the only one who opens Power BI - just click Refresh. Zero staff training on BI needed. This is 'Excel + Power BI' symbiosis, not replacement."

## File 3: sales/pre-sale-validation-playbook.md

**Key Discovery Questions Update:**

**NEW Question 1: "How do you currently track daily sales?"**
- If Excel: "Perfect! You'll keep using Excel, just upgrade the output."
- If POS only: "Great! We'll give you Excel templates that work with POS exports."
- Qualify: Excel comfort = Tier 1 fit, No Excel = Tier 2/3 needs setup help

**NEW Question 2: "Have you tried Power BI templates before?"**
- If Yes & Failed: "What stopped you?" -> Likely: data format -> Position: "Our Excel templates solve that exact problem."
- If No: "What's held you back?" -> Likely: complexity -> Position: "Our 30-minute setup removes that barrier."

**NEW Question 3: "Who would fill in daily data?"**
- If Owner only: Tier 1 (DIY)
- If Staff: Emphasize: "Staff use simple Excel dropdowns, 2 min/day. No BI training needed."
- If Multiple outlets: Tier 2/3 (multi-outlet consolidation)
