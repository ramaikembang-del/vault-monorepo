# Pricing Logic & Tier Analysis - Critical Assessment

**Product:** A1 - Power BI Template + Excel/Sheets Ecosystem
**Analysis Date:** January 2, 2026
**Analyst:** Comprehensive study of 63 documentation files
**Status:** **REVISED** - Product 01 is ONE-TIME PAYMENT ONLY (all support = Product 02)

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment:** The pricing logic is **80% solid** with innovative modular framework and smart cultural anchoring, but **20% has critical gaps** that will cause problems at first sale.

**Key Strengths:**
- Modular pricing eliminates "paying for unused features" objection
- Tier 2 economics validated (best profit/hour for founder-led sales)
- Cultural pricing anchors align with Indonesian SME psychology

**Critical Weaknesses:**
- **RESOLVED:** Tier 3 ongoing economics (Product 01 = one-time only, no monthly fees)
- **RESOLVED:** Tier 3 standardized to Rp 10-15M one-time (Product 01 only)
- **RESOLVED:** All policies documented in Appendix E (upgrade, refund, per-outlet)

---

## What Works Really Well

### 1. Modular Framework is Brilliant

**Why it works:**
- Eliminates the "I'm paying for features I don't need" objection
- Tier 1: Rp 3.5M (30) -> Rp 4.5M (40) -> Rp 6M (50) gives customers control
- Clear upgrade path without abandoning initial investment
- Psychologically smart: "Start small, add modules as you grow" reduces buyer anxiety

**Example from documentation:**
> Dimas starts with T1-Basic (Rp 3.5M, 30 metrics). Month 3, adds Revenue Intelligence module (+Rp 1M). Month 6, upgrades to Tier 2 (pays difference).

**This is much better than "Pay Rp 6M upfront or nothing."**

---

### 2. Tier 2 "Sweet Spot" Math Checks Out

**Unit Economics Validation:**

| Tier | Profit per Hour | Assessment |
|------|----------------|------------|
| Tier 1 | Rp 1.8M/hour | High margin, low value |
| **Tier 2** | **Rp 2M/hour** | **Best balance** |
| Tier 3 | Rp 290K/hour | High value, labor-intensive |

**For founder-led sales, Tier 2 IS the money maker.**

**Strategic implication:** Focus sales efforts on Tier 2, use Tier 1 as entry point, position Tier 3 as premium upsell.

---

### 3. Cultural Pricing Anchors Are Smart

**Pricing psychology aligned with Indonesian SME mindset:**

- **Tier 1 (Rp 3.5-6M):** "Modal tipis" mindset = low-risk entry point
- **Tier 2 (Rp 7-12M):** "Mau profesional tapi nggak mau ribet" = pay for convenience
- **Tier 3 (Rp 10-15M):** "Gue mau partner, bukan tools" = white-label + managed setup

**This aligns with the 10 Indonesian business angles:**
1. Modal Tipis, Margin Tipis (budget reality)
2. Gaptek Tapi Nggak Mau Ketinggalan (tech paradox)
3. WiFi Sering Mati (offline necessity)
4. Gue Nggak Mau Ribet (simplicity demand)
5. Gue Udah Punya Excel (migration friction)
6. Gue Mau Kayak Franchise Besar (aspiration)
7. Gue Nggak Percaya Data (skepticism)
8. Gue Nggak Punya Waktu Belajar (time scarcity)
9. Gue Takut Salah (risk aversion)
10. Stakeholder Buy-in (family business dynamics)

**Cultural positioning creates defensible moat that generic competitors can't replicate.**

---

### 4. Clear Customer Segmentation

**Tier-to-customer alignment is logical:**

| Tier | Outlets | Revenue/Year | Customer Profile | Validated |
|------|---------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| **T1** | 1 | Rp 420M-1B | Tech-savvy, budget-conscious, DIY mindset | 67% match (10/15 interviews) |
| **T2** | 2-3 | Rp 1-3B | Time-constrained, scaling, needs help | 67% match (8/12 interviews) |
| **T3** | 4-15 | Rp 4-18B | White-label + managed setup, DIY ownership | Validated (T3 beta) | Validated (T3 beta) |

**Market validation is strong.** Personas match real customer pain points.

---

## Critical Issues That Need Immediate Fix

### ISSUE #1: Tier 3 Ongoing Economics Are Broken

**The Problem (from unit-economics.md):**

| Period | Revenue | Cost | Profit | Assessment |
|--------|---------|------|--------|------------|
| **Month 1** | Rp 12.9M | Rp 3.45M | **+Rp 9.45M** | Profitable |
| **Month 2-12** | Rp 400K/mo | Rp 750K/mo | **-Rp 350K/mo** | **LOSING MONEY** |

**You're losing Rp 350K EVERY MONTH on Tier 3 recurring service.**

**Documentation acknowledges this but offers vague "fixes":**
> Option #2 (cap hours to stay profitable at Rp 400K):
> - 2 customizations/month -> 1 customization/month (saves Rp 200K)
> - Monthly call -> Quarterly call (saves Rp 200K on 2 months)

**My concern:** This assumes customers will accept LESS service than promised. Recipe for churn and bad reviews.

---

**REQUIRED FIX (Pick One):**

**Option A: Raise Monthly Fee** (Recommended)
- Change from Rp 400K -> **Rp 800-900K/month**
- Covers cost (Rp 750K) + 20% margin
- **Rationale:** Rp 900K/month for fully managed service is still cheaper than hiring in-house analyst (Rp 10M/month)
- **Market test:** Survey beta customers if Rp 900K is acceptable

**Option B: Make Ongoing Support Optional**
- Tier 3 = Rp 10-15M one-time (includes 3-6 months support)
- After 6 months: Customer chooses to renew support via Product 02 OR manages themselves
- **Benefit:** Simpler to sell, no forced recurring commitment
- **Risk:** Lose recurring revenue stream

**Option C: Cap Hours Explicitly in Contract**
- Change promise from "2 customizations/month" to **"1 customization/month + quarterly calls"**
- Set expectations upfront
- **Benefit:** Profitable at Rp 400K
- **Risk:** Customers expect more, feel shortchanged

**My recommendation: Option A + Option B hybrid**
- Tier 3 = Rp 10-15M one-time (includes 6 months support)
- Optional renewal: Rp 900K/month (unlimited support) OR Rp 400K/month (1 customization + quarterly calls)
- Customer chooses service level based on needs

---

### RESOLVED #2: Tier 3 Pricing Standardized

**Finding:** Different files state different Tier 3 prices.

**Evidence from documentation:**

**In product-strategy/README.md:**
> Tier 3: Rp 10-15M one-time (includes initial support | ongoing support options available separately - see Product 02)

**In unit-economics.md:**
> Tier 3 Setup: Rp 10-15M modular average
> Monthly: optional support standard

**In sales playbooks:**
> Tier 3 (Fully Managed): Rp 10-15M + Rp 300-500K/month

**In some pricing tables:**
> Tier 3: Rp 10-15M (100-150 metrics)

**This is confusing for both sales team AND customers.**

---

**REQUIRED FIX: Standardize Across ALL 63 Files**

**Decision needed:** Which pricing model?

**FINAL MODEL: Rp 10-15M One-Time Only**

- **Setup:** Rp 10-15M one-time

- **Includes:** White-label customization + fully managed setup

- **After setup:** Customer owns product forever

- **Support:** All ongoing support sold via Product 02 (separate purchase)
- **Total Year 1:** Rp 10-15M + (Rp 5.4M if renew 6 months) = Rp 25.4-30.4M

**Model B: Lower Setup, Required Ongoing** (Recurring revenue)
- **Setup:** Rp 10-15M one-time
- **Monthly:** Rp 900K/month (minimum 12 months)
- **Total Year 1:** Rp 10-15M + Rp 10.8M = Rp 20.8-25.8M

**Financially, both net similar Year 1 revenue (Rp 20-30M).**

**Recommendation: Model A**

**Why:**
- Simpler sales pitch: "Rp 10-15M, done"
- Aligns with Indonesian SME preference (avoid monthly subscriptions)
- Customer owns product after 6 months (less vendor dependency)
- Creates natural upsell moment at Month 6 (Product 02)

**Why not Model B:**
- Monthly fees scare Indonesian SMEs ("Langganan lagi...")
- Complex to explain: "Rp 10M + Rp 900K × 12 = Rp 20.8M total"
- Creates support burden (locked into servicing them)

**Action Required:**
1. Choose Model A or B
2. Create find-and-replace task for ALL 63 files
3. Update pricing tables, unit economics, sales scripts, proposals
4. Review and commit changes before first customer demo

---

### ISSUE #3: Module Pricing Feels Inconsistent

**The Problem:**

| Module Type | Price Each | Metrics Added | Price per Metric |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **T1 Modules** | Rp 1M | +10 | **Rp 100K/metric** |
| **T2 Modules** | Rp 1.25-1.5M | +11-15 | **Rp 83K-136K/metric** |
| **T3 Modules** | Rp 1.25M | +11-15 | **Rp 83K-113K/metric** |

**Customer objection:**
> "Wait, I'm paying MORE per metric in Tier 1? Why not just buy Tier 2?"

**Example:**
- Tier 1 Full (Rp 6M, 50 metrics) = Rp 120K/metric
- Tier 2 Base (Rp 7M, 50 metrics + assisted setup) = Rp 140K/metric BUT includes 2-3 hour setup call

**This could cannibalize Tier 1 sales.**

---

**Two Possible Interpretations:**

**Interpretation A: This is a Feature, Not a Bug**
- Tier 2 IS better value (that's the point)
- Tier 1 is for "I want to DIY and save money" customers
- If customer can afford Rp 7M, they SHOULD choose Tier 2 (better for both parties)
- **Accept that Tier 1 is entry point, Tier 2 is recommended sweet spot**

**Interpretation B: This is a Pricing Error**
- T1 modules should be cheaper per metric
- Adjust T1 module pricing to Rp 750K each (not Rp 1M)
- Makes Tier 1 more clearly "budget option"

**My Recommendation: Interpretation A + Add Messaging**

**Don't change pricing. Instead, add comparison messaging:**

```
"Tier 1 vs Tier 2 - Which is Right for You?"

Tier 1 (Rp 6M - 50 metrics):
 Best for: Tech-savvy owners who enjoy DIY setup
 You save: Rp 1M upfront
 You spend: 4-8 hours setup time (worth Rp 2-4M of your time)

Tier 2 (Rp 7M - 50 metrics + setup):
 Best for: Time-constrained owners scaling to 2-3 outlets
 You save: 4-8 hours (we do setup in 2-3 hour call)
 You get: Outlet-Summary.xlsx, 90-day support, 1 free customization
 Better value per rupiah

Recommendation: If you can afford Rp 7M, choose Tier 2.
Your time is worth more than Rp 1M.
```

**This turns "pricing inconsistency" into "Tier 2 value proposition."**

---

### ISSUE #4: Upgrade Pricing Math Not Documented

**The Problem:**

Multiple personas mention:
> "Rina uses Tier 1 for 3 months, then upgrades to Tier 2 by paying the difference."

**But WHAT is "the difference"?**

**Scenario:**
- Rina bought Tier 1 Full (Rp 6M, 50 metrics)
- 3 months later, wants Tier 2 Base (Rp 7M, 50 metrics + assisted setup)

**Does she pay:**
- **Option A:** Rp 1M (simple math: Rp 7M - Rp 6M)
- **Option B:** Rp 3M (value-based: Rp 1M difference + Rp 2M for foregone assisted setup)
- **Option C:** Rp 7M (no credit, restart from scratch)

**The documentation NEVER specifies this.**

---

**REQUIRED FIX: Create "Upgrade Pricing Policy" Document**

**Recommended Policy:**

```markdown
# Upgrade Pricing Policy

## Tier 1 -> Tier 2 Upgrade

**Within 90 Days of Purchase:**
- Pay simple difference: New Tier 2 price - Paid Tier 1 price
- Example: Paid Rp 6M (T1 Full) -> Upgrade to Rp 9.5M (T2 Base + 2 modules) = Pay Rp 3.5M
- **Limitation:** Assisted setup is NOT retroactive (you set up your existing dashboard yourself)
- **Benefit:** We'll do 1-hour review call to optimize your setup

**After 90 Days:**
- Pay 50% of difference (loyalty discount)
- Example: Paid Rp 6M -> Upgrade to Rp 9.5M = Pay Rp 1.75M (50% of Rp 3.5M)
- **Why discount:** You're a loyal customer who successfully used Tier 1

## Tier 2 -> Tier 3 Upgrade

**Within 180 Days:**
- Pay difference + 20% (Rp X - Rp Y) × 1.2
- Example: Paid Rp 9.5M (T2) -> Upgrade to Rp 12.5M (T3) = Pay Rp 13M × 1.2 = Rp 15.6M
- **Why 20% premium:** Tier 3 includes white-label customization (labor-intensive)

**After 180 Days:**
- Pay full Tier 3 price (no discount)
- **Reason:** Too much time passed, business has changed significantly

## Module Upgrades (Any Tier)

**Add Individual Modules:**
- Pay module price (Rp 1M - Rp 1.5M per module)
- No time limit
- Example: T1 Base (30 metrics) + add T1-A module later = Pay Rp 1M

## Downgrades

**NOT SUPPORTED**
- One-time payment is final purchase
- Cannot remove modules for refund
- **Exception:** If purchased within 14 days AND haven't used module yet, full refund available
```

**Why this policy:**
- **90-day window creates urgency** ("Upgrade now while discount lasts")
- **50% loyalty discount rewards early adopters**
- **No retroactive setup prevents gaming** (can't get back labor you didn't use)
- **Clear = fewer support tickets**

---

### ISSUE #5: Per-Outlet Pricing Unclear

**The Confusion:**

**From tier docs:**
- Tier 2: "2-3 outlets"
- Tier 3: "3-5+ outlets"

**From features:**
- Tier 2 includes "Outlet-Summary.xlsx (consolidates 3-5 outlet files)"

**Questions customers will ask:**
1. If I have 3 outlets, do I buy Tier 2 (Rp 7-12M) or Tier 3 (Rp 10-15M)?
2. Is the pricing per outlet or per customer?
3. If Tier 2 covers "2-3 outlets," do I pay Rp 7M once or Rp 7M × 3 = Rp 21M?

**I searched all 63 files. Answer: NOT EXPLICITLY STATED.**

**Implied answer (from context):** One purchase covers all outlets up to tier limit.

**But this needs to be SCREAMED FROM ROOFTOPS:**

---

**REQUIRED FIX: Add "Per-Outlet Pricing" Section**

**Recommended Addition to Pricing Docs:**

```markdown
## Outlet Coverage by Tier

### One Purchase Covers ALL Your Outlets (Up to Tier Limit)

**This is MASSIVE value compared to competitors who charge per-location.**

| Tier | Outlets Covered | Price | Price per Outlet |
|------|----------------|-------|------------------|
| **Tier 1** | 1 outlet (designed for) | Rp 3.5-6M | Rp 3.5-6M |
| **Tier 2** | 2-3 outlets | Rp 7-12M | **Rp 2.3-6M per outlet** |
| **Tier 3** | 3-5+ outlets | Rp 10-15M | **Rp 4-8.3M per outlet** |

**Example:**
- You have 3 cafés in Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya
- Buy Tier 2 Complete (Rp 12M) = ONE purchase
- Get: 1 dashboard with 100 metrics covering all 3 outlets
- Includes: Outlet-Summary.xlsx (consolidates all 3)
- Effective cost: Rp 4M per outlet (vs competitors at Rp 10-15M per outlet)

**What if I have MORE outlets than tier limit?**
- 1 outlet -> Tier 1 (Rp 3.5-6M)
- 2-3 outlets -> Tier 2 (Rp 7-12M) Recommended
- 4-5 outlets -> Tier 3 (Rp 10-15M)
- 6-10 outlets -> Consider Full SaaS Pro (C2) for advanced multi-outlet
- 10+ outlets -> Full SaaS Advanced (C3) required

**Can I buy multiple Tier 1 licenses for different outlets?**
- Technically yes (3 outlets × Rp 6M = Rp 18M)
- BUT: You'd manage 3 separate dashboards (messy)
- BETTER: Buy 1 Tier 2 (Rp 7-12M) with consolidated view
```

**This turns "unclear pricing" into "competitive advantage."**

---

### ISSUE #6: Refund Policy Inconsistent

**Evidence of contradiction:**

**In sales-playbook.md:**
> "30-day money-back guarantee"

**In proposal template:**
> "If dashboard doesn't work as demoed, full refund within 7 days"

**In FAQ (implied):**
> "14-day trial for Tier 1"

**Which is it? 7, 14, or 30 days?**

**Also undefined:**
- What counts as "doesn't work"?
- Is it per-tier or universal?
- What about Tier 2/3 where we've already delivered service (setup call, customization)?

---

**REQUIRED FIX: Add to legal/01-terms-of-service.md**

**Recommended Refund Policy:**

```markdown
## Refund Policy (Effective [Launch Date])

### Tier 1 (DIY Template)
**14-Day Technical Guarantee**
- Full refund if dashboard doesn't load, data import fails, or technical error prevents use
- Refund request must be submitted within 14 days of purchase
- **NOT eligible for refund:** "I don't like the design" or "I changed my mind" (subjective reasons)
- **How to request:** Email support@ with error screenshots

**Why 14 days (not 30):**
- 14 days is sufficient to validate technical functionality
- 30 days risks abuse (extract value, then request refund)

### Tier 2 (Assisted Setup)
**No Refund After Setup Call Completes**
- Service is "delivered" once 2-3 hour setup call happens
- Before setup call: Full refund available (if you cancel before scheduled call)
- **Exception:** If setup call fails due to OUR error (we couldn't deliver dashboard), full refund + Rp 500K inconvenience credit

### Tier 3 (Fully Managed)
**No Refund After Dashboard Delivered**
- Service is "delivered" once dashboard is handed off to customer
- Before handoff: Full refund available (if you cancel before we start work)
- **Exception:** If dashboard doesn't match agreed specifications (scope document), we'll fix OR refund

### Module Add-Ons (Any Tier)
**14-Day Refund Window**
- If you add a module and haven't used it yet (no data populated), full refund within 14 days
- Once you populate data in module, no refund (you've used the product)

### Upgrade Purchases
**No Refund on Upgrade Fees**
- Example: You paid Rp 6M (T1) -> Upgraded to T2 (paid Rp 1M difference) -> No refund on Rp 1M
- **Reason:** Upgrade fee is for incremental service already delivered
```

**Why this policy works:**
- **Clear definitions** of "doesn't work" (technical, not subjective)
- **Tier-appropriate** (DIY gets technical guarantee, Managed gets no refund after delivery)
- **Protects revenue** while being fair to customers
- **Reduces support burden** (clear rules = fewer disputes)

---

## What's Missing (Add Before Scaling)

### Missing #1: Volume/Multi-License Pricing

**Scenario:**
- Franchise with 10 outlets wants to rollout dashboard company-wide
- Buys 10 × Tier 1 (Rp 6M) = Rp 60M OR negotiates volume discount?

**Current state:** Not documented anywhere.

**Recommendation: Add Volume Discount Policy**

```markdown
## Volume Licensing (5+ Licenses)

**For Franchise, Multi-Brand, or Corporate Purchases:**

| Licenses | Discount | Effective Price |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| 5-9 licenses | 10% off | Rp 5.4M per (if T1 @ Rp 6M) |
| 10-19 licenses | 20% off | Rp 4.8M per |
| 20+ licenses | 30% off | Rp 4.2M per |

**Example:**
- 10 franchise outlets want Tier 1 Full (Rp 6M normally)
- Volume price: 10 × Rp 4.8M (20% off) = **Rp 48M** (save Rp 12M)

**Terms:**
- Must purchase all licenses at once (not incremental)
- All licenses same tier (can't mix T1 + T2)
- Support is per-license (each outlet gets independent support)

**Alternative: Upgrade to Full SaaS**
- If you need 10+ outlets, consider Full SaaS Advanced (C3) instead
- Centralized management, real-time data, API access
- Pricing: Rp 2-3.5M/month for unlimited outlets (better economics at scale)
```

---

### Missing #2: Family/Partner Discount

**Scenario:**
- Customer's friend/family also owns restaurant
- "Can I get discount if I refer my brother?"

**Current state:**
- Referral program documented (Rp 1M for Tier 2/3 referrals)
- But no "buy together" discount

**Recommendation: Add "Buy Together" Discount**

```markdown
## Buy Together Discount (2-4 Customers)

**If 2+ restaurant owners purchase together:**
- 2 customers: 5% off each
- 3 customers: 10% off each
- 4+ customers: 15% off each

**Example:**
- 3 café owners (friends) each want Tier 2 Base (Rp 7M)
- Together: 3 × Rp 6.3M (10% off) = Rp 18.9M total (save Rp 2.1M)

**Why this works:**
- Encourages group buying (viral growth)
- 10-15% discount is offset by 3× customer acquisition (net positive)
- Creates community (3 owners share best practices, higher retention)
```

---

### Missing #3: Early Adopter / Launch Pricing

**Current pricing is "Year 1 Launch Pricing" but not defined as limited-time.**

**From README.md:**
> Tier 1 (DIY): Rp 1.5-2M one-time (Year 2+: Rp 2.5-3M)

**This implies prices will increase in Year 2.**

**But:**
- Not communicated as urgency ("Buy now before price goes up!")
- No specific date when prices increase
- Existing customers grandfathered? Or everyone pays new price?

**Recommendation: Add Launch Pricing FAQ**

```markdown
## Launch Pricing (Limited Time)

**Current pricing is INTRODUCTORY for first 100 customers.**

| Tier | Launch Price (Now) | Regular Price (2026+) | You Save |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Tier 1 | Rp 3.5-6M | Rp 5-8M | Up to Rp 2M |
| Tier 2 | Rp 7-12M | Rp 10-15M | Up to Rp 3M |
| Tier 3 | Rp 10-15M | Rp 25-30M | Up to Rp 5M |

**Deadline:** First 100 customers OR December 31, 2026 (whichever comes first)

**Grandfathered Pricing:**
- If you buy at launch price, you KEEP that price forever (one-time payment)
- Module add-ons and upgrades: Launch price if purchased before deadline
- After deadline: Pay regular price for new purchases

**Why early adopter pricing:**
- You're taking risk on new product (we reward that)
- You'll provide feedback to improve product (beta tester value)
- You'll be case studies for future customers (marketing value)
```

**This creates URGENCY without being pushy.**

## Summary of Required Actions

### CRITICAL (Before First Sale)

| # | Issue | Fix Required | Owner | Deadline |
|---|-------|--------------|-------|----------|
| 1 | RESOLVED: Product 01 one-time only | No action needed (support = Product 02) | Product | Done |
| 2 | RESOLVED: Tier 3 standardized | Rp 10-15M confirmed across docs | Product | Done |
| 3 | No upgrade pricing policy | Create policy document | Sales | Before demo |
| 4 | Per-outlet pricing unclear | Add "One purchase = all outlets" messaging | Marketing | Before demo |
| 5 | Refund policy inconsistent | Standardize in legal/TOS | Legal | Before demo |

**Estimated effort:** 8-12 hours to fix all critical issues.

**Consequence of NOT fixing:** Custom pricing negotiations on EVERY deal, angry customers, support burden.

---

### IMPORTANT (Before Scaling to 50+ Customers)

| # | Missing Element | Action | Owner | Deadline |

| 7 | Module pricing perception | Test with beta customers, adjust if needed | Product | Month 6 |
| 8 | Buy-together discount | Add group buying incentive | Marketing | Month 3 |
| 9 | Launch pricing deadline | Set urgency, grandfather early adopters | Product | Launch day |

---

### NICE TO HAVE (Future Optimization)

| # | Enhancement | Action | Owner | Deadline |
|---|------------|--------|-------|----------|
| 10 | Tier 0 freemium | Consider free tier with watermark | Product | Year 2 |
| 11 | Annual payment discount | 10% off if pay yearly vs monthly (T3) | Finance | Quarter 2 |
| 12 | Loyalty program | Points for referrals, upgrades, tenure | Marketing | Quarter 3 |

---

## Final Verdict

**Would I buy this product at these prices?**

**As Dimas** (1 café, Rp 420M revenue, budget-conscious):
- **YES** - Tier 1 at Rp 3.5-4.5M is fair
- Comparable to 1 month of consultant (Rp 5M) but I own it forever
- ROI: If I save 2% food cost (Rp 840K/month), pays for itself in 4-5 months

**As Amanda** (3 cafés, Rp 1.8B revenue, time-poor):
- **YES** - Tier 2 at Rp 8-10M is a steal
- vs Hiring BI consultant (Rp 20-50M): Save 50-75%
- vs DIY 8 hours setup: My time worth Rp 500K/hour = Rp 4M saved
- One purchase covers all 3 outlets = Rp 2.6-3.3M per outlet (bargain)

**As Andi** (8 outlets, Rp 12B revenue, strategic):
- **MAYBE** - Tier 3 at Rp 10-15M, but I'd push back on monthly fee confusion
- I'd want 100% clarity: Is ongoing support included or optional?
- I'd negotiate: "Give me Rp 10M one-time with 12 months support included, then I decide if I renew"
- If you can't clarify, I'd hire in-house analyst instead (more control)

**The pricing is defensible IF you fix the critical gaps.**
