### 2. unit-economics.md

**Changes Made:**

 - 5 × Tier 3 @ Rp 12M setup = Rp 60M
 - **Total: Rp 377.5M** (explains why Rp 250M target is conservative)

## Summary of Key Number Changes

| Metric | Before | After | Rationale |

| **Year 1 customer mix** | 90 T1 / 50 T2 / 10 T3 (60/33/7%) | 120 T1 / 25 T2 / 5 T3 (80/17/3%) | Realistic early-bird discount dominance |

| **Year 2 customers** | Not specified | 400 cumulative (250 new) | Explicit customer count target |
| **Year 3 revenue** | Rp 600M | Rp 800M | Includes Rp 480M Tier 3 MRR accumulation |

## What This Means for Sprint 1

### Sales Team

**OLD (Confusing):**
- "Market size is 10,000 or 500,000 or 750,000?" - Sales didn't know which number to use
- "Are we targeting Rp 1.67M avg or Rp 6.76M avg customers?" - Unclear sales quotas

**NEW (Clear):**
- **TAM:** "100,000 modern restaurants in Indonesia"
- **SAM:** "20,000-25,000 can afford our product (Rp 2-17M one-time)"
- **Year 1 Target:** "150 customers, avg Rp 1.67M (mostly discounted Tier 1 early-bird)"
- **Q1-Q4 Targets:** 15 -> 30 -> 50 -> 60 incremental sales (155 total, rounds to 150)

### Finance Team

**OLD (Revenue Math Didn't Work):**
- Year 1: 150 customers × ??? avg = Rp 250M
- Year 3: ??? customers × ??? avg = Rp 600M
- Blended model showed Rp 6.76M avg (4x higher than implied Rp 1.67M!)

**NEW (Math Validated):**
- Year 1: 150 customers × Rp 1.67M avg (80% T1 @ Rp 1.5M) = Rp 250M
- Year 2: 400 customers total, Rp 400M (new sales + upgrades + MRR)
- Year 3: 650 customers total, Rp 800M (includes Rp 480M Tier 3 MRR)
- Blended avg: Rp 1.67M (Year 1 launch) -> Rp 2.5M (Year 2) -> Rp 3M (Year 3) as tier mix evolves

### Marketing Team

**OLD:**
- Target personas doc said "10,500 SAM" but strategy doc implied 20K+
- No clarity on whether "500K F&B outlets" or "100K restaurants" was correct TAM

**NEW:**
- **Product 01 TAM:** 100,000 modern restaurants (our specific market)
- **Product 01 SAM:** 20-25K restaurants (can afford Rp 2-17M one-time purchase)
- **Company TAM:** 750K F&B UMKM (all products combined - different from Product 01)
- **Messaging:** "We serve 100K modern restaurants. 20K can afford us. We're targeting 650 by Year 3 = 3.25% market share"

## Remaining TODOs (Priority 2-3, Not Blocking Sprint 1)

### Week 2-3 Actions:

1. **Add full data source citations to market-analysis.md:**
 - BPS report URL/year
 - Pawoon/Moka/Qasir user count sources
 - Bandung market study findings document

2. **Create bottom-up city validation table:**
 - Tier 1 cities (Jakarta 15K, Surabaya 10K, Bandung 8K)
 - Tier 2 cities (5 cities × 5K each)
 - Tier 3 cities (15 cities × 3K each)
 - **Total: ~100K modern restaurants** (validates TAM)

3. **Build detailed Year 1-3 revenue model with:**
 - Monthly MRR tracking (shows Tier 3 buildup)
 - Tier 1 -> 2 upgrade assumptions (30% annual upgrade rate)
 - Cohort retention curves (Year 1 cohort stickiness)

4. **Cascade changes to derivative docs:**
 - README.md (update market size claims)
 - Sales playbook (update TAM/SAM talking points)
 - Marketing one-pager (update "10,000 potential customers" -> "20,000 SAM")
