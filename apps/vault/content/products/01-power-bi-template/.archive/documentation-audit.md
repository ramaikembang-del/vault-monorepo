## Sprint 1 Readiness Assessment

### Can Product 01 Launch in Sprint 1 (Week 1-2)? YES

**Minimum Viable Documentation Exists For:**
- Tier 1 (DIY Template) - 100% ready
- Tier 2 (Assisted Setup) - 70% ready (can wing remote setup)
- Tier 3 (Fully Managed) - 60% ready (need proper SOP)

**Sprint 1 Launch Status:**
- Week 1-2: Tier 1 launch READY
- Week 2+: Tier 2/3 upsells RISKY without SOPs

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 - MUST CREATE (Blocking for Quality Launch)

1. **sales/demo-script.md** (1-2 hours)
 - 30-minute template walkthrough script
 - Key talking points for each tier
 - Transition to pricing conversation

2. **sales/objection-handling.md** (2 hours)
 - Top 10 objections + responses
 - "Too expensive" -> ROI calculator
 - "Already using Excel" -> Limitations comparison

3. **operations/tier-2-3-onboarding-sop.md** (3 hours)
 - Remote setup checklist
 - Screen sharing agenda
 - Handoff to maintenance

### Priority 2 - SHOULD CREATE (Needed for Scale)

4. **marketing/competitive-comparison.md** (4 hours)
 - vs Excel (free but manual)
 - vs Tableau (expensive, complex)
 - vs Google Data Studio (limited)

5. **marketing/one-pager.md** (2 hours)
 - Single-page product sheet
 - Visual pricing comparison
 - Customer testimonial placeholder

6. **training/troubleshooting-kb.md** (4 hours)
 - Common issues + fixes
 - "Dashboard not refreshing"
 - "Blank values in metrics"

### Priority 3 - NICE TO HAVE (Polish)

7. **business-intelligence/unit-economics.md**
8. **legal/sla-definitions.md**
9. **customer-success/health-scoring.md**

## Scoring vs "Utmost Standalone" Expectation

### Overall Score: 7.5/10

**Breakdown:**
- Technical Quality: 10/10 (World-class)
- Operations: 9/10 (Excellent)
- Product Strategy: 7/10 (Good)
- Sales Enablement: 4/10 (Weak)
- Marketing: 6/10 (Adequate)
- Customer Success: 6/10 (Basic)
- Legal/Compliance: 2/10 (Minimal)

**Verdict:**
> **"FUNCTIONAL BUT NOT EXCEPTIONAL"**
>
> Product 01 has **world-class technical and operational documentation** but is **underweight on go-to-market execution materials**. An engineer could build this product perfectly. A sales team would struggle.
>
> **For Sprint 1 Tier 1 (DIY) launch:** Ready
> **For professional SaaS company standards:** Need 6-8 hours of additional documentation

## What "Utmost Standalone" Would Look Like

A truly standalone product documentation package would allow **any competent team to run this business without asking questions**:

 **You have:**
- Complete build guide
- Operational playbooks
- Pricing strategy
- Basic marketing

 **You're missing:**
- Sales execution playbook (how to close deals)
- Competitive battle cards (how to win against alternatives)
- Customer success playbooks (how to prevent churn)
- Financial model (how to forecast revenue)

---

## Conclusion

**Product 01 documentation is 75% complete** for professional standalone business documentation standards.

**Strong Foundation:** Technical and operational excellence.
**Critical Gaps:** Sales, competitive positioning, customer success depth.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create 3 Priority 1 docs (6-7 hours total)
2. This brings readiness to 85%
3. Sprint 1 can launch successfully with current docs + those 3

**Action Required:** Create sales-playbook.md, demo-script.md, tier-2-3-onboarding-sop.md before first customer call.
