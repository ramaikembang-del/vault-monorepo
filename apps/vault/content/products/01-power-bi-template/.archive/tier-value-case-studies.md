- Staff: 8 people (2 kitchen, 4 service, 2 cashier)
- Operating Days: 300 days/year (closed Mondays)
- Daily Transactions: ~80 customers/day

**Cost Structure (F&B industry standard):**
- Food Cost: 35% of revenue = Rp 147M/year
- Labor Cost: 30% of revenue = Rp 126M/year
- Rent & Utilities: 15% of revenue = Rp 63M/year
- Other OpEx: 10% of revenue = Rp 42M/year
- **Net Profit Margin: 10%** = Rp 42M/year

**Owner Profile:**
- Age: 28, owns café for 2 years
- Tech comfort: Can use Excel, Instagram, YouTube tutorials
- Time value: Rp 150-200K/hour (opportunity cost of owner time)
- Budget constraint: Max comfortable spend Rp 5-6M for analytics

---

### Current State (Before Dashboard)

**Time Spent on Manual Reporting:**
- Daily: 30 minutes entering sales to Excel (300 days × 0.5 hrs = **150 hours/year**)
- Weekly: 2 hours creating summary reports (50 weeks × 2 hrs = **100 hours/year**)
- Monthly: 3 hours consolidating for accountant (12 months × 3 hrs = **36 hours/year**)
- **Total: 286 hours/year** on manual Excel work

**Quantified Cost of Time:**
- 286 hours × Rp 200K/hour = **Rp 57.2M/year** (owner opportunity cost)

**Known Business Problems (from persona pain points):**
1. **Food cost leak:** Suspects 2-3% waste/portion inconsistency (unquantified)
2. **Staff performance unclear:** Doesn't know which staff underperform
3. **No inventory tracking:** Manual counting, frequent stockouts
4. **Menu insights missing:** Doesn't know which items most profitable

---

### Solution Impact (After Tier 1 Dashboard)

**Time Savings:**
- Daily entry: **ELIMINATED** (POS auto-exports to dashboard)
- Weekly reports: 2 hours -> 15 minutes (**87.5% reduction** = 87.5 hours/year saved)
- Monthly consolidation: 3 hours -> 30 minutes (**83% reduction** = 30 hours/year saved)
- **Total time saved: 267.5 hours/year**

**Business Improvements (from transformation narrative):**

**1. Food Cost Reduction**
- **Baseline assumption:** Dimas discovers 2% food cost leak via dashboard
- Current food cost: 35% of Rp 420M = Rp 147M/year
- 2% reduction: Rp 147M × 2% = **Rp 2.94M/year saved**

**How dashboard enables this:**
- Recipe cost calculator shows 3 menu items over 40% food cost (should be 30-35%)
- Identifies portion inconsistency (staff "generous" portions = waste)
- Action: Standardize portions, remove high-cost low-margin items

**2. Revenue Recovery - Menu Optimization**
- **Baseline assumption:** Identifies 1 underperforming category (beverages)
- Dashboard shows: Beverages = 15% of sales (should be 25% for cafés)
- Gap: 10% of Rp 420M = Rp 42M revenue opportunity
- **Conservative capture:** 25% of gap = **Rp 10.5M revenue increase**

**How dashboard enables this:**
- BCG matrix shows beverages in "Dog" quadrant (low sales, low margin)
- Action: Introduce 3 seasonal signature drinks, upsell training for staff
- Month 4-12 result: Beverage category grows 8% -> 23% of sales

**3. Staff Efficiency**
- **Baseline assumption:** Identifies 1 underperforming staff via dashboard
- Staff leaderboard shows 1 cashier: Rp 2.5M sales/month vs team avg Rp 4M
- Gap: Rp 1.5M/month × 12 = **Rp 18M/year** underperformance
- **Action taken:** Training OR replacement, recovers 50% of gap = **Rp 9M/year**

**How dashboard enables this:**
- Daily sales per staff tracked automatically
- Drill-through shows cashier's peak hours (11am-1pm) = only Rp 800K vs others Rp 1.5M
- Root cause: Slow order taking, no upselling
- Solution: 2-week training, improvement in Month 2

### Value Calculation Summary

| Value Driver | Calculation | Annual Value |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Time Savings** | 267.5 hrs × Rp 200K/hr | Rp 53.5M |
| **Food Cost Reduction** | Rp 147M × 2% | Rp 2.94M |
| **Revenue Recovery** | Rp 42M gap × 25% captured | Rp 10.5M |
| **Staff Efficiency** | Rp 18M gap × 50% recovered | Rp 9M |
| **Total Annual Value** | | **Rp 75.94M** |

**Price Paid:** Rp 4.5M (Tier 1 - Base + 1 module)

**First Year ROI:** Rp 75.94M ÷ Rp 4.5M = **16.9× return**

**Payback Period:** (Rp 4.5M ÷ Rp 75.94M) × 12 months = **0.7 months (3 weeks)**

---

### Assumptions Validation

**Conservative or Aggressive?**

 **Conservative assumptions:**
- Time value: Rp 200K/hr (many consultants charge Rp 500K-1M/hr)
- Food cost reduction: 2% (industry case studies show 3-5% typical)
- Revenue capture: 25% (many capture 50-100% of identified gap)
- Staff efficiency: 50% recovery (training often yields 70-80% improvement)

**If using aggressive (but realistic) assumptions:**
- Time value: Rp 500K/hr -> Time savings = Rp 133.75M
- Food cost: 3% -> Savings = Rp 4.4M
- Revenue: 50% capture -> Rp 21M
- Staff: 80% recovery -> Rp 14.4M
- **Total: Rp 173.55M value** = **38.6× ROI**

**Conclusion:** Even with ultra-conservative assumptions, Tier 1 delivers **17× ROI**. Customer would be irrational NOT to buy at Rp 4.5M.

- Time value: Rp 500K/hour (management consulting background)
- Has investor/partner (35% equity stake) -> needs professional reporting
- Budget: Willing to spend Rp 8-12M for proper analytics

---

### Current State (Before Dashboard)

**Multi-Outlet Complexity:**

**Time Spent on Consolidation:**
- Daily: 45 minutes per outlet entering sales (3 outlets × 45 min × 360 days = **810 hours/year**)
- Weekly: 5 hours consolidating 3 Excel files manually (50 weeks × 5 hrs = **250 hours/year**)
- Monthly: 6 hours preparing investor reports (12 × 6 hrs = **72 hours/year**)
- Quarterly: 12 hours board presentation prep (4 × 12 hrs = **48 hours/year**)
- **Total: 1,180 hours/year** (Amanda + managers combined)

**Quantified Cost:**
- Amanda's time: 400 hours × Rp 500K/hr = Rp 200M
- Managers' time: 780 hours × Rp 150K/hr = Rp 117M
- **Total opportunity cost: Rp 317M/year**

**Known Problems (from persona):**
1. **"I don't know which outlet underperforms"** - No consolidated view
2. **"Manager accountability unclear"** - Can't compare manager performance
3. **"Investor wants professional reports"** - Excel looks amateur, trust issues
4. **"Which products to launch/kill?"** - No cross-outlet menu analysis

---

### Solution Impact (After Tier 2 Dashboard)

**Time Savings:**
- Daily entry: **ELIMINATED** (automated import from 3 POS systems)
- Weekly consolidation: 5 hours -> 20 minutes (**93% reduction** = 233 hours/year)
- Monthly investor reports: 6 hours -> 30 minutes (**91% reduction** = 66 hours/year)
- Quarterly board prep: 12 hours -> 2 hours (**83% reduction** = 40 hours/year)
- **Total time saved: 1,139 hours/year**

**Business Improvements:**

**1. Outlet Performance Gap Identified**

**Dashboard insight (Week 2):**
- Outlet comparison page shows:
 - Jakarta Selatan: Rp 65M/month (108% of target)
 - Tangerang: Rp 58M/month (97% of target)
 - Depok: **Rp 27M/month** (**45% of target!**)

**Root cause analysis (via drill-through):**
- Depok location: Traffic 40% lower than other outlets
- Same menu, same pricing -> location issue, not product
- Manager performance: Sales per staff at Depok = Rp 3.4M vs Jakarta Rp 6.8M

**Action taken:**
- Month 1-2: Investigate. Find: Location has parking issues, low foot traffic
- Month 3: Decision - relocate Depok outlet OR negotiate rent reduction
- Negotiated: Rent reduced from Rp 25M/month -> Rp 15M/month
- Marketing push: Instagram ads for Depok area
- Manager replacement: New manager Month 4

**Result (Month 6-12):**
- Depok revenue: Rp 27M -> Rp 45M/month (67% improvement)
- Gap closed: (Rp 45M - Rp 27M) × 7 months (Month 6-12) = **Rp 126M recovered**
- Rent savings: Rp 10M/month × 9 months (Month 4-12) = **Rp 90M saved**
- **Total outlet optimization value: Rp 216M**

**2. Cross-Outlet Menu Optimization**

**Dashboard insight:**
- "Brown Sugar Pearl" sells well in Jakarta (35% of sales) but only 18% in Depok
- Depok customers prefer fruit-based drinks (45% vs 22% Jakarta)

**Action:**
- Month 2: Introduce 2 fruit-based signature drinks at Depok
- Month 3: Promote seasonal fruit drinks

**Result:**
- Depok average transaction value: Rp 32K -> Rp 38K (+19%)
- Incremental revenue: Rp 6K × 150 customers/day × 300 days (Month 3-12) = **Rp 270M**
- BUT conservative attribution: Only 30% is from menu change = **Rp 81M**

**3. Labor Cost Optimization**

**Dashboard insight:**
- Jakarta Selatan labor cost: 26% of outlet revenue (efficient)
- Tangerang: 28% (acceptable)
- Depok: **38%** (way too high! Revenue Rp 27M, labor Rp 10.3M/month)

**Root cause:**
- Depok overstaffed: 8 people like other outlets, but 40% lower traffic
- Sales per staff: Rp 3.4M vs Jakarta Rp 8.1M

**Action:**
- Month 2: Reduce Depok staff from 8 -> 6 (2 cashiers -> 1, 2 kitchen -> 1)
- Redeploy 2 staff to Tangerang (busier location)

**Result:**
- Depok labor cost: Rp 10.3M/month -> Rp 7.7M/month (saving Rp 2.6M/month)
- Annual savings (10 months): **Rp 26M**
- No revenue impact (still serve 150 customers/day with 6 staff)

**4. Investor Credibility & Fundraising**

**Qualitative value:**
- Month 3: Investor meeting with professional Power BI dashboard
- Investor feedback: "This looks like a Rp 50B company, not Rp 5B startup"
- Month 6: Series A fundraising begins

**Quantified value (subjective but real):**
- Series A valuation: Rp 12B (with professional dashboard) vs estimated Rp 10B (with Excel)
- Amanda's 65% stake: Rp 7.8B vs Rp 6.5B
- **Wealth increase: Rp 1.3B** (one-time, attributed 10% to dashboard credibility = **Rp 130M**)

### Value Calculation Summary

| Value Driver | Calculation | Annual Value |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Time Savings** | 1,139 hrs (400 Amanda + 739 managers) | Rp 310.85M |
| **Outlet Optimization** | Depok revenue recovery + rent savings | Rp 216M |
| **Menu Optimization** | Cross-outlet insights (30% attribution) | Rp 81M |
| **Labor Cost Reduction** | Depok overstaffing fix | Rp 26M |

| **Total Annual Value** | | **Rp 763.85M** |

**Price Paid:** Rp 9.5M (Tier 2 - Base + 2 modules, most popular)

**First Year ROI:** Rp 763.85M ÷ Rp 9.5M = **80.4× return**

**Payback Period:** (Rp 9.5M ÷ Rp 763.85M) × 12 months = **0.15 months (4.5 days)**

---

### Assumptions Validation

**Conservative or Aggressive?**

 **Conservative assumptions:**
- Time value: Rp 500K/hr Amanda, Rp 150K/hr managers (market rate)
- Outlet gap recovery: Only counted 7 months (Month 6-12), not full year
- Menu optimization: Only 30% attribution (could be higher)
- Labor savings: Only 10 months (Month 3-12), not 12
- Investor credibility: Only 10% attribution to dashboard (very conservative)

**If using moderate assumptions:**
- Outlet recovery: Full 12 months -> Rp 216M × (12/7) = Rp 370M
- Menu optimization: 50% attribution -> Rp 135M
- Investor credibility: 20% attribution -> Rp 260M
- **Total: Rp 1,002M value** = **105× ROI**

**Conclusion:** Even with ultra-conservative assumptions, Tier 2 delivers **80× ROI**. The Rp 9.5M investment pays for itself in **4.5 days**.

---

### Assumptions Validation

**Conservative or Aggressive?**

 **Ultra-conservative assumptions:**
- **Rates:** CEO Rp 1M/hr (vs Rp 2M/hr Western standard), CFO Rp 500K/hr
- **All improvements:** Only count PARTIAL year
- **Analyst:** Only 3 months strategic work counted

**Conclusion:** Tier 3 delivers **53× ROI** in Year 1. At Rp 12.5M, it pays for itself in less than 7 days.

## Key Insights

### 1. All Tiers Deliver 16-80× First-Year ROI
Even ultra-conservative assumptions show every tier pays for itself within 1 month.

### 2. Why Tier 2 Has Highest ROI Ratio?
Multi-outlet insights are MOST impactful at 2-3 outlet stage (discovering first underperformer = huge "aha"). 8-outlet operator already has some systems, so incremental value is lower.

### 3. Pricing Strategy Validation
Current pricing is strategically correct for market entry. 16-80× ROI creates no-brainer purchases and fast adoption.

### 4. Underpricing is Intentional Land-Grab
The "leaving money on table" is a FEATURE. Fast adoption > profit maximization in Year 1.
