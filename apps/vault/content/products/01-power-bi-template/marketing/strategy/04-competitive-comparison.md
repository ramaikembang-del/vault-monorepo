## Head-to-Head Comparisons

### 1. vs. Excel (Most Common Competitor)

**What Customer Says:**
> "I already use Excel. It's free and I know how to use it."

**Our Response:**

"Excel is fantastic for **data storage**, but here's the difference:

#### Excel = Manual Labor (3-4 hours/week)

**Your Current Process:**
1. Export CSV from POS every Monday
2. Open Excel workbook
3. Copy-paste new data
4. Fix broken formulas (vlookup errors, pivot tables not updating)
5. Manually create charts (bar charts for revenue, tables for staff ranking)
6. Repeat every week

**Annual Cost of Your Time:**
- 3 hours/week x 52 weeks = **156 hours/year**
- If your time is worth Rp 100K/hour -> **Rp 15.6M/year**

---

#### Power BI Template = Automated Intelligence (30 seconds/day)

**Your New Process:**
1. Click 'Refresh' in Power BI
2. All 50-100 metrics update automatically (depending on tier)
3. Done

**Annual Time Saved:** 155 hours
**ROI:** Pays for itself in <6 months

---

**Features Excel Can't Do (Without Heavy Coding):**

| Metric | Excel Effort | Our Template |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Hourly Revenue Heatmap** | 2 hours to build, breaks every month | Pre-built, auto-updates |
| **Staff Performance Score** (6 components) | 4-5 hours (complex formula) | Pre-built with drill-through |
| **Customer Patronage Ladder** (First-timer -> VIP) | 3+ hours (need multiple sheets) | Pre-built, visual funnel |
| **Revenue Waterfall** (Walk-in + Reservations + Upsells - Discounts) | 2 hours to configure | Pre-built, auto-calculated |
| **NPS Score & Sentiment Analysis** | Manual (no auto word cloud) | Pre-built with visual |

**Bottom Line:** We're not replacing Excel. We're giving you 150 hours of pre-built F&B analytics that would take you 40-60 hours to build yourself."

**Win Rate:** 75% (when we show side-by-side time comparison)

---

### 2. vs. Google Sheets (Cloud Collaboration Angle)

**What Customer Says:**
> "I use Google Sheets because my team can access it anywhere."

**Our Response:**

"Google Sheets is great for **team collaboration**. But for **analytics**, it has the same limitations as Excel:

#### Google Sheets Strengths:
 Cloud-based (access anywhere)
 Real-time collaboration
 Free

#### Google Sheets Weaknesses for F&B Analytics:
 No built-in F&B metrics (you build from scratch)
 Slow with large datasets (>10,000 rows lag)
 Charts are basic (no interactive drill-throughs)
 Manual refresh (still copy-pasting POS data)

---

#### How Our Solution Compares:

**Collaboration:** If you publish to Power BI Service (cloud), your team can access it anywhere (web + mobile app).

**Performance:** Power BI handles **millions of rows** without lag. Your 1-year transaction history (50K+ rows) loads in 2 seconds.

**Visuals:** Interactive drill-throughs. Click on a staff name -> See their detailed performance. Google Sheets can't do this.

**Automation:** Connect to your POS database (SQL/API) -> Auto-refresh daily. No manual copy-paste.

---

**When to Use Each:**

| Use Case | Recommend |
|----------|-----------|
| Team collaboration on editable docs (budgets, checklists) | **Google Sheets** |
| Data analysis & business intelligence (metrics, dashboards) | **Power BI Template** |

**They complement each other—not competitors.**"

**Win Rate:** 60% (some customers still prefer Sheets for simplicity)

---

### 3. vs. Tableau (Enterprise BI Tool)

**What Customer Says:**
> "I've heard Tableau is the best. Why not use that?"

**Our Response:**

"Tableau **IS** the industry standard for enterprise BI. It's what Fortune 500 companies use. But here's why it's overkill for your restaurant:

#### Tableau Costs:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| **Tableau Creator License** | $70/user/month (USD) = **Rp 1.1M/month/user** |
| **Setup (hire consultant)** | Rp 50-100M (for custom build) |
| **Training** (3-day course) | Rp 10-15M/person |
| **Annual Total (1 user):** | **Rp 13M/year + Rp 50M setup** |

**Our Tier 2:** Rp 7-12M one-time. **68-85% cheaper.**

---

#### When Tableau Makes Sense:
- 50-100+ outlets (multi-country operations)
- $10M+ annual revenue (in USD)
- Dedicated BI team (3-5 analysts)
- Complex data from 10+ systems (ERP, CRM, Accounting, POS, Inventory)

**That's not you (yet).**

---

#### When Our Template Makes Sense:
- 1-5 outlets (Indonesian SME F&B)
- Rp 8-12B annual revenue
- No BI team (owner + 1-2 managers)
- 1 data source (POS system)

**This is right-sized for your operation.**

---

**Analogy:**
> 'Tableau is like buying a Ferrari to drive to the warung. Yes, it's the best car. But you don't need it. You need a reliable Toyota that gets you there at 1/10th the cost.'

**Win Rate:** 90% (Tableau is obviously too expensive for SMEs)

---

### 4. vs. Power BI Pro License (DIY Power BI)

**What Customer Says:**
> "Can't I just buy Power BI Pro ($10/month) and build this myself?"

**Our Response:**

"Absolutely! Power BI Pro gives you the software. But here's what you'd need to do:

#### DIY Power BI (If You Build Yourself):

**Step 1: Learn Power BI** (20-40 hours)
- YouTube tutorials, online courses
- Practice with sample datasets
- Learn DAX (formula language) and Power Query

**Step 2: Design Your Data Model** (10-15 hours)
- Figure out which tables to use (Sales, Staff, Customers, Products, Targets)
- Create relationships between tables
- Build date dimension (for time intelligence)

**Step 3: Build 50-100 Metrics** (30-50 hours)
- Research which metrics matter for F&B
- Write DAX formulas for each metric (Base + Professional modules)
- Test calculations (compare to POS reports)

**Step 4: Design Dashboards** (15-20 hours)
- Layout each tab (Revenue, Staff, Customers)
- Choose visuals (cards, charts, tables)
- Apply color theme, add company logo

**Total Time:** **75-125 hours**

**Your Time Cost (if worth Rp 100K/hour):** Rp 7.5M - 12.5M

---

#### Our Template (Tier 2):

**What You Get:**
- All 75 hours of work already done
- Proven F&B metrics (tested with real restaurants) - 50-100 metrics modular
- 2-3 hour assisted setup (we do it WITH you)
- 90-day support

**Cost:** Rp 7-12M one-time (modular pricing based on metrics selected)

**You Save:** 72-122 hours + avoid trial-and-error mistakes

---

**When DIY Makes Sense:**
- You're a Power BI expert (already built 5+ dashboards)
- You have 3-4 weeks of free time
- You enjoy learning new tools

**When Our Template Makes Sense:**
- You want results NOW (not in 3 months)
- You'd rather spend time running your restaurant (not learning BI tools)
- You want F&B-specific metrics (not generic templates)

**Analogy:**
> 'You CAN build your own house if you learn carpentry. Or you can buy a pre-fabricated house that's move-in ready. Same logic.'

**Win Rate:** 85% (most restaurant owners don't have 100+ hours to learn Power BI)

---

### 5. vs. POS Built-In Reports (Pawoon, Moka, Qasir)

**What Customer Says:**
> "My POS already has reports. Why do I need this?"

**Our Response:**

"Great question. Your POS reports are **necessary but not sufficient**. Here's why:

#### POS Reports = Transactional Data (WHAT Happened)

**What Your POS Shows:**
 Total sales today: Rp 28M
 Best-selling items: Nasi Goreng (120 orders)
 Payment method breakdown: 60% cash, 40% e-wallet
 Hourly sales: Lunch Rp 12M, Dinner Rp 16M

**What POS Reports DON'T Show:**

 **Why** revenue is down (upsells too low? Discounts too high?)
 **Which staff** are underperforming (discipline issues? Low sales per hour?)
 **How many VIPs** are churning (revenue at risk?)
 **Gap to annual target** (are you on track for Rp 12B?)

---

#### Power BI Dashboard = Analytical Layer (WHY It Happened + WHAT TO DO)

**What Our Dashboard Adds:**

 **Revenue Intelligence:**
- Gap to Target: Rp 3.8B behind -> Need Rp 35M/day
- Upsell opportunity: Only 11% of revenue (should be 15-20%) = Rp 2M/day missing

 **Staff Performance:**
- Performance Score ranking: Rina (87/100) vs Siti (52/100)
- Discipline Score: Siti late 8x, 3 early outs -> Coaching opportunity

 **Customer Loyalty:**
- VIP churn: 23 VIPs haven't visited in 45+ days -> Rp 4.1M at risk
- First-timer retention: Only 62% return (benchmark: 75%) -> Fix onboarding

---

**Analogy:**
> 'Your POS is like a car's speedometer (shows current speed). Our dashboard is the GPS (shows if you're on the right route to reach your destination).'

**Integration:**
- POS = Data source (where data comes from)
- Dashboard = Intelligence layer (what the data means)
- They work TOGETHER, not against each other

**Win Rate:** 80% (once they see dashboard in demo, they get it)

---

### 6. vs. Hiring a Data Analyst

**What Customer Says:**
> "Can't I just hire an analyst to do this monthly?"

**Our Response:**

"You could! Let's compare:

#### Hiring a Data Analyst

**Monthly Cost:**
- Freelance analyst: Rp 5-8M/month (for 10-15 hours/month)
- Full-time analyst: Rp 8-12M/month salary

**What You Get:**
- Custom reports every month
- Ad-hoc analysis when you ask
- Fresh insights (if they're good)

**Risks:**
- Analyst leaves -> You lose all knowledge
- Slow turnaround (2-3 days per report)
- Expensive at scale (Rp 60-96M/year)

---

#### Our Tier 3 (Enterprise - Fully Managed)

**Monthly Cost:**
- Rp 10-15M one-time + **optional support (see Product 02)**

**Annual Total:** Rp 14.8M - 19.8M (Year 1) | Rp 4.8M (Year 2+)
**vs. Analyst:** Rp 60-96M/year

**You Save:** Rp 40-76M/year

---

**When to Hire Analyst:**
- 10+ outlets (complex multi-location analysis)
- Need predictive modeling / ML (forecasting future trends)
- $10M+ revenue (can afford Rp 8-12M/month)

**When Our Template Works:**
- 1-5 outlets (straightforward analytics)

**Win Rate:** 70% (Tier 3 competes well on cost vs hiring)
