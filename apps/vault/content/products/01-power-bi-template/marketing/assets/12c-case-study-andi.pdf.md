## Story Outline

### The Challenge
- Andi operated 3 cloud kitchens serving 5 delivery brands
- Each kitchen manager reported different numbers
- No unified view of performance across locations
- Couldn't identify which brands/locations were profitable
- Delivery platform fees eating into margins invisibly

- Multi-location consolidated reporting
- Brand-level profitability analysis
- Delivery fee impact tracking (GoFood, GrabFood, ShopeeFood)

### The Results
- Discovered 2 of 5 brands were unprofitable - shut them down
- Reallocated kitchen capacity to high-margin brands
- Increased consolidated profit by 40% (Rp 150M -> Rp 210M monthly)
- ROI: 3 months
- Quote: *"Ternyata brand favorit saya justru yang paling rugi. Data tidak berbohong."*
