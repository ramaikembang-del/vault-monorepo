### 3.3 Writing Best Practices

**DO:**

1. **Lead with Results** (headline should include specific outcome)
 - "Saved Rp 2M/Month"
 - "Customer Success Story"

2. **Use Specific Numbers** (avoid vague claims)
 - "23-day payback period"
 - "Quick ROI"

3. **Include Customer Voice** (3-5 direct quotes minimum)
 - Makes it authentic, not marketing fluff

4. **Show Before/After** (contrast creates impact)
 - Before: 4 hours/week on Excel
 - After: 10 minutes/week automated

5. **Address Objections** (preempt common fears)
 - "I tried Power BI before and failed" -> Excel templates solved it

6. **Make it Skimmable** (busy prospects scan, not read)
 - Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)
 - Bolded key stats
 - Quote boxes
 - Tables for data

**DON'T:**

1. Don't make it about the product (make it about customer success)
2. Don't use jargon ("leverage synergies" -> "save time")
3. Don't exaggerate (be factual, quote customer exactly)
4. Don't skip approval (customer must sign off)
5. Don't write too long (800-1200 words max, not 3000+)

Hi [Lead Name],

I know you're evaluating analytics tools for [your café/restaurant].

I wanted to share this: [Customer Name] (café owner in [City]) just shared their results with our Power BI template.

Key stats:
- Setup: 30 minutes
- First insight: 24 hours
- Savings: Rp 2.1M/month
- Payback: 23 days

Full case study: [Link]

[Customer's] situation might sound familiar:
"I spent 4 hours every Monday updating Excel pivot tables..."

Sound like you?

Reply if you want to discuss how this could work for your business.

- [Sales Rep Name]
```

### 6.2 Sales Enablement

**How Sales Team Uses Case Studies:**

**Stage 1: Discovery Call**

**Usage:** Send case study BEFORE call (pre-read)

**Email Template:**
```
"Hi [Prospect], before our call tomorrow, I wanted to share a quick story.

[Customer Name] had a similar challenge (manual Excel, 4 hours/week time waste).

Here's how they solved it: [Case Study Link]

See you tomorrow at [Time]!"
```

**Benefit:** Prospect comes to call educated, less time selling

---

**Stage 2: Proposal**

**Usage:** Include case study as appendix in proposal PDF

**Page Layout:**
```
Proposal Section 5: Customer Success Stories

"Here's what similar businesses achieved:

[2-page case study PDF embedded]"
```

**Benefit:** Social proof right before pricing (reduces price objection)

---

**Stage 3: Objection Handling**

**Objection:** "I tried Power BI before, too complicated"

**Response:**
```
"You're not alone - 60% fail with generic BI templates.

That's exactly what happened to [Customer Name]. [He/She] bought a Power BI template 6 months before us, gave up after 8 hours.

What changed? Excel templates. [His/Her] staff didn't need to learn Power BI.

Here's [his/her] story: [Link]

Can I show you how the Excel templates work?"
```

**Benefit:** Case study validates that we solve the exact problem they fear
