## Opening (2 minutes)

### Script:

**"Selamat pagi/siang, Pak/Bu [Name]. Terima kasih sudah menyempatkan waktu."**

"Quick question before we start: How do you currently track your daily sales? Excel? POS reports?"

**[LISTEN. This determines demo focus]**

**If Excel:**
"Perfect! I'm going to show you how to keep using Excel (your staff loves it, right?) but get professional dashboard insights automatically. Sound good?"

**If POS only:**
"Great! I'll show you simple Excel templates that work with your POS exports, plus the dashboard. 30 minutes total setup."

"Let's dive in."

---

## Discovery Questions (3 minutes)

**Ask 3-5 questions to qualify:**

1. **"How many outlets do you operate?"**
 - 1 outlet -> Tier 1/2 likely
 - 2-5 outlets -> Tier 2/3 likely
 - 6+ outlets -> May need SaaS platform instead

2. **"What POS system do you use?"**
 - Pawoon/Moka/Qasir -> Easy integration
 - Custom/Legacy -> May need CSV export assistance (Tier 2/3)

3. **"Who currently looks at your sales reports?"**
 - Just me (owner) -> Tier 1 DIY may work
 - Owner + manager -> Tier 2/3 for collaborative setup

4. **"How often do you check your numbers?"**
 - Weekly -> Basic Excel may be enough (risky prospect)
 - Daily -> Good fit for dashboard
 - Multiple times per day -> Excellent fit

5. **"What's preventing you from hitting your revenue target this year?"**
 - Staff issues -> Focus on Tab 2 (Wolf Pack)

**[Take notes. Tailor demo to their pain point]**

---

## Demo Structure (25 minutes)

### Part 1: THE KEY - Excel Template Walkthrough (10 minutes)

**THIS IS THE DIFFERENTIATOR - Don't skip this!**

**Script:**
**"Most Power BI templates fail because no one tells you HOW to get your data in the right format. That's why we give you pre-formatted Excel templates."**

---

#### Step 1: Show Daily-Sales.xlsx (3 minutes)

**[Share screen - Open Daily-Sales.xlsx]**

"This is what your staff fills out every day. It takes 2 minutes."

**[Point to dropdown menus]**
- "Product name: Dropdown menu. Staff just picks from list (no typos)."
- "Staff name: Dropdown. Auto-validates."
- "Price: Auto-populates from lookup table. Zero manual entry."
- "Total: Auto-calculates. Can't mess it up."

**[Fill in one sample row]**

- Qty: 2
- **Price auto-fills: Rp 30,000**
- **Total auto-calculates: Rp 60,000**
- Staff: "Budi" (dropdown)

**"See? 15 seconds per transaction. At end of day, save file. That's it."**

---

#### Step 2: Show Food-Cost.xlsx (2 minutes)

**[Open Food-Cost.xlsx]**

"This one tracks recipe costs. Look:"

**[Point to Nasi Goreng recipe]**
- Beras: 150g × Rp 20/g = Rp 3,000
- Ayam: 100g × Rp 50/g = Rp 5,000
- Telur: 1 × Rp 2,000 = Rp 2,000
- **Total Cost: Rp 12,000**
- **Selling Price: Rp 30,000**
- **Food Cost %: 40%** WARNING (should be < 35%)

**"Instant insight: Nasi Goreng is eating your margins. Maybe reduce portion 20g or raise price Rp 2K."**

---

#### Step 3: The Magic - One-Click Import (3 minutes)

**[Open Power BI Desktop]**

"Now watch this. This is the 'kacamata' (glasses) moment."

**[Live demo]**
1. "All my Excel files are in one folder: C:\F&B-Data\"
2. "Power BI is already set up to read that folder."
3. **[Click Refresh button]**
4. **Wait 5 seconds...**
5. "Done. Dashboard updated."

**[Pause for reaction]**

"That's the system. Staff fills Excel (2 minutes/day). You click Refresh (5 seconds). Dashboard updates. **Total time: 30 minutes to learn, 2 minutes daily forever.**"

**"vs typical 'Power BI template'? 8 hours figuring out CSV format, constant errors. That's why we bundle Excel templates."**

---

### Part 2: Power BI Dashboard Highlights (10 minutes)

**[Now that they've seen Excel -> Power BI flow, show the output]**

**"Let me show you what insights you get from those Excel files..."**

**Quick Tour (2 min per tab = 6 min total):**

2. **Staff Performance:**
 - Leaderboard (Rina Rp 4.2M/shift vs Siti Rp 1.8M/shift)
 - "If bottom 5 perform like top 5 = Rp 8M/day extra"
 - Discipline score (who's late, who has errors)

3. **Customer Loyalty:**
 - First-timers vs Repeaters
 - 23 VIPs haven't visited 45+ days = Rp 4.1M at risk
 - Word cloud: "Slow service" (47x) vs "Enak" (89x)

**[Keep this section SHORT - they already get it from Excel demo]**

---

### Part 3: The Value Proposition (3 minutes)

**Script:**

"Let's summarize what you're getting:"

**[Show pricing slide with bundle breakdown]**

**Bundle Components:**
1. Power BI Dashboard (visualization)
2. Excel Template Suite (4-5 files depending on tier)
3. Google Sheets option (mobile-friendly)
4. One-click refresh script (5 seconds daily)

**"This isn't just a Power BI template. It's a complete data system. Excel (input) + Power BI (insights). That's why it works."**

---

## Transition to Pricing (Standard Path)

1. **YTD Revenue: Rp 8.2B / Target 12B**
 - "You're Rp 3.8B behind. But here's the key question: Is it fixable?"

2. **Required Daily Run Rate: Rp 35M**
 - "To hit 12B by year-end, you need Rp 35M per day. Currently doing Rp 28M. That's the gap."

3. **Revenue Waterfall**
 - **[Click to expand]**
 - "See how revenue builds? Walk-in Rp 18M + Reservations Rp 8M + Upsells Rp 3M - Discounts Rp 1M = Net Rp 28M."
 - **Key insight:** "Upsells are only 11% of revenue. Industry best-practice is 15-20%. That's Rp 2-3M per day you're leaving on the table."

4. **Hourly Heatmap**
 - **[Hover over cells]**
 - "See this? Fridays 7-9 PM is your money-printing time. But you're understaffed-only 12 servers when you should have 16. You're literally turning customers away during peak."

**Pause for reaction:** "Does this match what you're seeing in your business?"

---

**Tab 2: Wolf Pack (Staff Performance) - 5 minutes**

**[Click to Staff tab]**

"Now, the uncomfortable truth: Not all your staff are equal."

**Performance Score Leaderboard:**

1. **[Point to top 3]**
 - "Rina: Performance Score 87/100. She's Gold tier. Sells Rp 4.2M per shift."
 - "Budi: 76/100, Silver tier. Rp 3.1M per shift."
 - "Siti: 52/100, Bronze tier. Rp 1.8M per shift."

2. **The Gap:**
 - "Siti works the same hours as Rina but produces 57% less revenue. If you could coach your bottom 5 to perform like your top 5, that's an extra Rp 8-12M per day."

3. **Discipline Score (NEW)**
 - **[Click drill-through on Siti]**
 - "Here's why Siti is struggling: Late 8 times this month, 3 early outs, 12% order error rate. She's not bad-she's untrained or burned out."

**Key Message:** "This dashboard doesn't just show numbers. It shows you WHO to coach and WHAT to fix."

---

**Tab 3: Loyalty Loop (Customer Intelligence) - 5 minutes**

**[Click to Customer tab]**

"Last piece: Are customers coming back?"

**Patronage Ladder:**

1. **First-Timers: 450 this month**
 - "450 new customers. Great acquisition."

2. **Repeaters (2-3 visits): 280**
 - "But only 62% came back. Industry benchmark is 75%. You're losing 58 customers per month who tried you once and never returned."

3. **VIPs (4+ visits): 95**
 - "Your VIPs are your gold. They spend Rp 180K per visit vs Rp 95K for first-timers."
 - **[Show Revenue at Risk]**
 - "23 VIPs haven't visited in 45+ days. That's Rp 4.1M in monthly revenue at risk."

**NPS & Feedback:**

- **[Show Word Cloud]**
 - "Your customers say: 'Slow service' appears 47 times. 'Enak' (delicious) appears 89 times. You're winning on food, losing on speed."

**Close Tab 3:** "So you know WHAT'S working (food) and WHAT to fix (service speed)."

---

## Transition to Pricing (Alternate Path - If Skipping Part 2)

**Script:**

"Okay, that's the dashboard. Now, quick question: If this saved you 3 hours per week and helped you find an extra Rp 5-10M in monthly revenue, what's that worth to you?"

"We offer 3 ways to get this, depending on how tech-savvy you are and how much hand-holding you want."

## Qualification & Recommendation (2 minutes)

**Based on discovery answers, recommend:**

| Situation | Recommend | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| 1 outlet, owner-operated, tech-savvy | **Tier 1** | Cost-effective, capable of DIY |
| 1-2 outlets, has manager, wants help | **Tier 2** | Sweet spot-setup assistance removes friction |
| 3-5 outlets, scaling fast, no time | **Tier 3** | Needs ongoing support, not one-time setup |
| 6+ outlets, needs real-time | **Refer to SaaS Platform** | Template won't scale, need cloud solution |

**Script:**

"Based on what you told me-[summarize their situation]-I'd recommend **Tier [X]** because [reason]."

"Does that make sense for your operation?"

---

## Handling Objections (See [[products/01-power-bi-template/sales/strategy/05-objection-handling|objection-handling.md]])

**Top 3 you'll hear:**

### 1. "Too expensive"
**Response:**
"I hear you. Let's do quick math: If this dashboard helps you find one underperforming staff member costing you Rp 2M/month, or identifies one menu item with 40% food cost that should be 28%, it pays for itself in 2-3 months. After that, it's pure profit."

"Tier 2 is Rp 6M. That's Rp 200K per day for 30 days. You probably lose more than that to food waste or staff theft every single day."

---

### 2. "I already use Excel"
**Response:**
"Perfect! That's exactly why this works. You KEEP using Excel. Your staff keeps filling the same data entry they do now."

"The difference: Instead of spending 3 hours making pivot tables, you click 'Refresh' and Power BI reads your Excel files automatically. 5 seconds."

"We're not asking you to abandon Excel. We're giving Excel 'glasses' so you can see the data clearly. **Excel + Power BI symbiosis.**"

---

### 3. "Let me think about it"
**Response:**
"Absolutely, this is an investment decision. Can I ask-what specifically do you need to think about? Is it budget, or are you not convinced this solves [their pain point]?"

**[If budget:]** "I can offer payment plan: 50% now, 50% after you see the dashboard working with your data."

**[If unsure:]** "How about this: I'll send you a sample dashboard with dummy data. Play with it for 3 days. If it doesn't wow you, no obligation."

---

## Closing (3 minutes)

**Trial Close:**

"So, if we go with Tier [X], when would you want to be up and running?"

**[If "ASAP" or specific date]** -> Hard close

"Perfect. Here's what happens next:
1. I'll send you the invoice today (Rp [amount])
2. Once paid, I'll email the template files (Tier 1) OR schedule our setup call (Tier 2/3)
3. Tier 1: You're live in 2-4 hours. Tier 2/3: Live within 48 hours of our call.
4. You start seeing these insights immediately."

"Sound good? I'll send the invoice to [email] in the next hour."

---

**[If hesitant]** -> Soft close

"No pressure. But let me ask: What would need to happen for you to say 'yes' to this?"

**[Listen to their condition. Address it. Re-close.]**
