## OBJECTION HANDLING CHEAT SHEET

**"Too expensive"**
-> "Let's do quick math: If this finds one underperforming staff member costing Rp 2M/month, or one menu item with 40% food cost that should be 28%, it pays for itself in 2-3 months."

**"I already use Excel"**
-> "Great! We're not replacing Excel. Staff keep using Excel for input. Power BI just reads it and creates dashboards. Zero change to your workflow."

**"What if I outgrow the tier?"**
-> "Easy. Upgrade anytime by paying the difference. Within 90 days, just pay price difference. Most T1 customers move to T2 within 6 months as they grow."

**"Can I try before I buy?"**
-> "Yes! T1 is exactly that - **Rp 3.5M** to try. If you love it, upgrade to T2 later by paying the difference (**Rp 3.5M more**). Most do."
