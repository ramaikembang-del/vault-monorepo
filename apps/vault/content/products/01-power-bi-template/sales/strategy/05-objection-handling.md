**Usage:** Study before demo calls, reference during negotiation

---

## NEW: Ecosystem Bundle Objections (Top 3)

### 1. "I already bought a Power BI template and it didn't work"

**Frequency:** Very Common (30% of prospects who've tried templates before)

**Response:**

"You're not alone. 60% of people who buy Power BI templates fail to get them working. Want to know why?

**They give you the .pbix file and say 'good luck.' No guidance on:**
- How to format your data
- What structure Power BI expects
- How to connect your POS exports

**You spend 8 hours trying to figure out CSV format, get frustrated, give up.**

**That's EXACTLY why we built this differently:**

 **Excel Templates Included** - Pre-formatted, fool-proof
- Daily-Sales.xlsx: Dropdowns for product/staff (no typos possible)
- Food-Cost.xlsx: Recipe calculator (traffic light alerts)
- Staff-Log.xlsx: Performance tracker (leaderboard auto-ranks)

 **You literally fill in the blanks** - No CSV format confusion
 **30-minute setup** - Watch 10-min video -> Fill Excel -> Click Refresh -> Done
 **90% success rate** - Because Excel templates solve the #1 failure point

**The missing link from other templates? Pre-formatted Excel files. That's our secret sauce.**

Does that make sense why this is different?"

---

### 2. "Why is this more expensive than other Power BI templates?"

**Frequency:** Common (20% of price-sensitive prospects)

**Response:**

"Great question. Let's compare:

**Other Templates (Rp 1.5-2M):**
- .pbix file only
- No Excel templates
- No Google Sheets option
- No video tutorials
- No automation setup
- **Total:** 1 file

**Our Bundle (Rp 3.5-6M T1, Rp 7-12M T2):**
- Power BI .pbix file
- 4 Excel templates (worth Rp 1M if bought separately)
- Google Sheets versions (worth Rp 500K)
- One-click automation (worth Rp 500K)
- 5 video tutorials (worth Rp 500K)
- Modular metrics framework (30-150 metrics organized in 12 modules)
- **Total Value: Rp 6-8M -> Your Price: Rp 3.5-6M (T1) or Rp 7-12M (T2) based on modules**

**We're not more expensive. We're the SAME PRICE for 5x more value.**

**Plus:**
- Their success rate: 40% (60% give up)
- Our success rate: 90% (Excel templates = game changer)
- Their time-to-insight: 8 hours
- Our time-to-insight: 30 minutes

**You're not paying more. You're getting a complete system vs a file."

---

### 3. "My staff won't use Power BI" / "Too technical for my team"

**Frequency:** Very Common (25%)

**Response:**

"You're 100% correct! And that's why **staff DON'T touch Power BI at all.**

**Here's how it works:**

**Staff (Excel - familiar):**
- Fill Daily-Sales.xlsx (dropdowns, 2 min/day)
- Fill Food-Cost.xlsx (recipe calculator)
- Fill Staff-Log.xlsx (sales tracking)
- **Tools:** Excel (they already know it)
- **Training needed:** 5 minutes

**Owner/Manager (Power BI - you only):**
- Open Power BI Desktop
- Click "Refresh" button
- Dashboard updates in 5 seconds
- **Tools:** Power BI (only YOU need to learn)
- **Training needed:** 10-min video

**This is 'Excel + Power BI' SYMBIOSIS:**
- Staff: Input (Excel - no change to workflow)
- Owner: Output (Power BI - professional insights)
- **Zero staff training on BI needed**

**We're not asking staff to learn Power BI. We're keeping their familiar Excel and upgrading YOUR insights.**

Does that address the concern?"

## Framework: LAER Method

**L** - Listen (don't interrupt)
**A** - Acknowledge (validate their concern)
**E** - Explore (ask clarifying questions)
**R** - Respond (address with value/proof)

## Top 15 Objections & Responses

### 1. "Too Expensive" / "Mahal banget"

**Frequency:** Very Common (40% of prospects)

**Response Option A: ROI Calculator**

"I understand Rp 7-12M (Tier 2) feels like a big investment. Let me show you the math:

- **Food waste:** Most restaurants lose 3-5% revenue to waste. For Rp 8B operation, that's Rp 10M-20M per month. If this dashboard helps you cut waste by just 1%, that's Rp 6.6M/month saved. Pays for itself in Month 1.

- **Staff productivity:** You have 20 staff. If bottom 5 performers improved to match your average, that's Rp 8-12M extra revenue per month. Dashboard shows you exactly who to coach.

- **Customer retention:** You're losing 40% of first-time customers. If you retain just 10 more customers per month (Rp 180K average spend × 4 visits/year), that's Rp 7.2M annual value.

**Total potential:** Rp 15-25M per month. Dashboard costs Rp 6M one-time.

Does spending Rp 6M to find Rp 15-25M/month make sense?"

---

**Response Option B: Comparison to Alternatives**

"Compared to what? Let's look at your options:

| Solution | Cost | Effort | Insights |
|----------|------|--------|----------|
| **Excel (what you're doing now)** | Free | 3-4 hours/week (Rp 600K/month in your time) | Basic, manual |
| **Hire Data Analyst** | Rp 8-12M/month | None (they do it) | Custom, but expensive |
| **Tableau/Power BI Pro License** | Rp 500K/month/user + Rp 20-30M setup | High learning curve | Professional, but you build from scratch |
| **Our Tier 2** | Rp 6M one-time | 1 session setup, then 30 sec/day | Professional, plug-and-play |

You're not paying Rp 6M for software. You're paying for **150 hours of analytics work we already did** so you don't have to."

---

**Response Option C: Payment Plan**

"If budget timing is the issue, I can split it:
- 50% (Rp 3M) now to start
- 50% (Rp 3M) in 30 days after you see results

Or, start with **Tier 1 (Rp 3.5-6M Essentials - 30-50 metrics)** and upgrade to Tier 2 later if you need help."

---

### 2. "I Already Use Excel" / "Udah pakai Excel aja"

**Frequency:** Very Common (35% of prospects)

**Response:**

"Excel is fantastic for data storage. But here's the difference:

**Excel = Manual Labor:**
- You export CSV from POS every week
- Copy-paste into formulas
- Fix broken vlookups
- Update pivot tables
- **Time:** 3-4 hours per week
- **Risk:** One wrong formula = wrong decisions

**Power BI Dashboard = Automated Intelligence:**
- Connect once to your data source
- Click 'Refresh' (30 seconds)
- All charts, KPIs, insights update automatically
- **Time:** 30 seconds per day
- **Risk:** Zero. Calculations never break.

**Plus:** Excel can't show you that hourly heatmap, staff performance leaderboard, or customer patronage ladder without heavy manual work. This dashboard has 30-150 metrics organized in a modular framework (you choose which modules you need).

**Question:** How much is 3 hours of your time worth per week? Rp 600K/month? Rp 1.2M? Over a year, you'll spend Rp 7-14M in time using Excel. This is Rp 6M one-time and gives you better insights."

---

### 3. "Let Me Think About It" / "Nanti saya pikir-pikir dulu"

**Frequency:** Common (25%)

**Response (Explore First):**

"Absolutely, this is an important decision. Can I ask-what specifically do you need to think about?

- Is it the **budget**? (If yes -> offer payment plan)
- Are you unsure if this solves **[their pain point]**? (If yes -> offer trial/demo extension)
- Do you need to **consult with partner/spouse**? (If yes -> offer joint call)
- Is it **timing**-you're too busy right now? (If yes -> calendar follow-up)"

**[Listen to their real objection. Then address it specifically.]**

---

**If Budget:**

"I can work with you on payment. 50% now, 50% in 30 days. Does that help?"

---

**If Unsure of Value:**

"Fair. How about this: I'll send you a **sample dashboard with dummy data**. Spend 15 minutes playing with it. If it doesn't solve [their pain point], no hard feelings. If it does, we move forward. Sound fair?"

---

**If Timing:**

"I get it, you're slammed. When's a better time? I'll follow up then. Meanwhile, I'll email you the proposal so you have everything in writing."

---

### 4. "I Don't Have Time to Learn Power BI"

**Frequency:** Common (20%)

**Response:**

"You don't need to learn Power BI. That's the whole point.

**Tier 1 (Essentials - 30-50 metrics):** Yes, you set it up yourself. If you're not tech-savvy, don't choose this.

**Tier 2 (Professional - 50-100 metrics):** I set it up with you on a screen-sharing call. You watch, I click. After 1 session, the dashboard is ready. All you do is click 'Refresh' once a day. That's it.

**Tier 3 (Enterprise - 100-150 metrics):** I do everything. You literally never touch Power BI. I send you a PDF report every week, or you log in to view live dashboard. Zero learning curve.

**Which tier sounds better for you?"**

---

### 5. "My POS Already Has Reports"

**Frequency:** Common (20%)

**Response:**

"Great! Most modern POS systems (Pawoon, Moka, Qasir) have basic reports. Let me ask:

- Can your POS show you **staff performance score** with discipline tracking (late, early out, order accuracy)?
- Can it show you **customer patronage ladder** (first-timer vs VIP behavior)?
- Can it calculate **required daily run rate** to hit your annual target?
- Can it show you **hourly revenue heatmap** to optimize staffing?

**POS reports show WHAT happened (sales Rp 28M yesterday).
This dashboard shows WHY (upsells too low, staff #7 underperforming, 23 VIPs haven't returned).**

Your POS is the data source. This is the intelligence layer that tells you what to do about it."

---

### 6. "I Need to Talk to My Partner/Co-Owner"

**Frequency:** Occasional (15%)

**Response:**

"Makes total sense. Do you want me to join that conversation? I can do a quick 15-minute call with both of you to answer their questions. It's easier than you explaining technical details.

When are you meeting with them? I'll block my calendar."

**[Offer to do joint call. Increases close rate from 30% -> 60%]**

---

### 7. "What If My Data Isn't Clean?"

**Frequency:** Occasional (15%)

**Response:**

"Good question. Dirty data is common. Here's how we handle it:

**Tier 1 (Essentials):** You'll need to clean it yourself. I provide data cleaning guide.

**Tier 2 (Professional):** During our setup call, I'll look at your data and show you what needs fixing. Usually takes 30 min - 1 hour (one-time). Examples:
- Missing product categories -> We create a lookup table
- Duplicate staff names -> We standardize
- Inconsistent date formats -> We fix in Power Query

**Tier 3 (Enterprise):** I clean your data as part of setup. You don't touch anything.

**Reality check:** 80% of clients have messy data. It's not a blocker-it's part of the process."

---

### 8. "I Only Have 1 Outlet, Is This Overkill?"

**Frequency:** Occasional (12%)

**Response:**

"Actually, 1 outlet is perfect for this dashboard. Here's why:

**Overkill would be:** Enterprise BI platform for Rp 50-100M. That's for 10-50 outlets.

**This is right-sized for 1-5 outlets.** You get:
- Revenue intelligence (are you hitting targets?)
- Staff performance (20-person team is hard to manage without data)
- Customer retention (even 1 outlet needs to know if VIPs are churning)

**Most of my clients are 1-3 outlet operators.** You're in the sweet spot.

**Question:** If you're doing Rp 8-12B revenue with 1 outlet, would you rather guess where the money is going, or know for sure?"

---

### 9. "Can I Just Buy the Template and Figure It Out Later?"

**Frequency:** Common (18%)

**Response:**

"Absolutely! That's **Tier 1 Essentials (Rp 3.5-6M)."**

You get:
- Complete .pbix template
- Setup documentation
- 30-day email support

**Here's what you need to succeed with Tier 1:**
- Comfortable with Power BI Desktop (you've used it before, or willing to learn)
- 2-4 hours to connect your data and configure
- Patience to troubleshoot if something breaks

**If that sounds like you:** Tier 1 is perfect.

**If that sounds stressful:** Tier 2 adds 3 hours of my time to set it up WITH you for +Rp 3M. Most clients find the hand-holding worth it to avoid frustration.

Which sounds better?"

---

### 10. "I Don't Trust Cloud/Data Security"

**Frequency:** Occasional (10%)

**Response:**

"I love this objection-it means you're smart about security.

**Good news: This is NOT cloud-based by default.**

**How it works:**
- Dashboard runs on **your local computer** (Power BI Desktop = free, offline)
- Data sits on **your SQL Server or local CSV files**
- **Nothing leaves your premises** unless you choose to publish to Power BI Service (cloud)

**You control your data 100%.**

**Optional (if you want cloud later):**
- Power BI Service (cloud hosting) - YOU decide if/when to upload
- You can password-protect reports
- Data never shared with third parties

**Privacy = priority. This is your data, your dashboard, your control."**

---

### 11. "What If I Want to Customize It?"

**Frequency:** Occasional (12%)

**Response:**

"Great question. Customization depends on tier:

**Tier 1 (Essentials - 30-50 metrics):**
- Full .pbix source file -> You can edit anything
- Add new metrics, change colors, create custom visuals
- **Caveat:** You need Power BI skills. If you break something, you fix it.

**Tier 2 (Professional - 50-100 metrics):**
- Same as Tier 1, but I'll help with 1 round of minor customizations during setup (e.g., change color scheme, add logo)
- After delivery, you own the file and can edit freely
- Can add additional modules from the 12-module framework

**Tier 3 (Enterprise - 100-150 metrics):**
- I handle all customizations (up to 2 custom metric requests per month included)
- Want a new chart? I add it in next monthly update.
- Module additions handled as part of ongoing support

**Bottom line:** This isn't locked. You own the .pbix file. Edit away. But if you want me to do it, that's Tier 3."

---

### 12. "I'll Just Hire a Freelancer to Build This"

**Frequency:** Occasional (8%)

**Response:**

"You absolutely could. Let me show you the math:

**Freelancer Cost:**
- Power BI developer: Rp 500-800K/hour
- To build this dashboard from scratch: 40-60 hours (data model, DAX, visuals, testing)
- **Total: Rp 20-48M** (if they're experienced)
- **Risk:** Freelancer disappears after delivery, no support

**Our Tier 2:**
- Rp 6M one-time
- 90-day support included
- Template already built and tested with real F&B data
- Updates when we improve the template (Tier 3 gets this automatically)

**You're not paying for build time. You're paying for:**
1. **150 hours of F&B industry expertise** (we know which metrics matter for restaurants)
2. **Proven template** (not experimental freelancer work)
3. **Ongoing support** (we don't disappear)

Save yourself Rp 14-42M and 2 months of back-and-forth with a freelancer."

---

### 13. "I'm Already Working with a Consultant"

**Frequency:** Occasional (6%)

**Response:**

"Perfect! This actually works great WITH consultants.

**How this fits:**
- Consultant gives you strategic advice (menu engineering, cost reduction, expansion plans)
- This dashboard gives you the **data** to validate their recommendations

**Example:** Consultant says 'Cut staff costs by 10%.' This dashboard shows you exactly which 2-3 staff are underperforming so you make informed decisions, not blind cuts.

**I'm not replacing your consultant. I'm giving them (and you) better data to work with.**

Want me to do a quick call with your consultant to show how this integrates? Many consultants love this because it makes THEIR job easier."

---

### 14. "What If I Outgrow This?"

**Frequency:** Occasional (8%)

**Response:**

"Excellent problem to have! Here's the upgrade path:

**Template is good for:**
- 1-5 outlets (can duplicate dashboard per location)
- 20-100 staff
- Manual daily refresh (30 seconds)

**If you outgrow it (6+ outlets, need real-time data, need mobile app):**
- Upgrade to **Full SaaS Platform** (products C1-C4 in our catalog)
- Rp 300K-8M/month depending on features
- **Migration included:** We export your historical data from this template to cloud platform

**You're not locked in. Think of this as Phase 1 (prove the value of analytics). If you scale to 10 outlets, we have Phase 2 ready.**

Most clients stay on the template for 1-2 years before outgrowing it."

---

### 15. "Can You Give Me a Discount?"

**Frequency:** Common (22%)

**Response Option A: Value-Based**

"I price based on value, not negotiation. Let me ask:

If I gave you 20% off (Rp 1.2M discount), would you say yes right now?"

**[If YES]:**
"Okay, here's the deal: I'll give you 15% off if you:
1. Pay in full today (not installment)
2. Give me a testimonial after 30 days
3. Refer 1 other restaurant owner for demo

That's Rp 5.1M instead of Rp 6M. Deal?"

**[If NO]:**
"Then the issue isn't price-it's value. What would make you confident this is worth Rp 6M?"

---

**Response Option B: Bundling**

"I don't discount, but I can add value:

Instead of Rp 6M Tier 2, I'll include:
- 1 extra month of support (120 days instead of 90)
- 1 additional customization request
- Priority onboarding (setup within 48 hours instead of 1 week)

Same price, more value. Work for you?"

---

**Response Option C: Volume**

"I don't discount for single purchases. But if you have 2-3 restaurant owner friends, I can offer:

- **2 Tier 2 licenses:** Rp 11M (Rp 1M off)
- **3 Tier 2 licenses:** Rp 16M (Rp 2M off)

Want to organize a group buy?"

---

### 16. "Why do I need to choose modules? Just give me everything" (NEW - Modular Framework)

**Frequency:** Common (18% since modular launch)

**Response:**

"Great question! You CAN get everything-that's **Tier 3 (Enterprise - 100-150 metrics)** with all 12 modules included.

But here's why most clients DON'T want everything right away:

**Information Overload:**
- 150 metrics = 15-20 dashboard pages
- Takes 2-3 hours just to explore everything
- You end up focusing on 30-40 metrics anyway (the ones relevant to YOUR business)

**Smarter Approach (Modular Framework):**

**Tier 1 (30-50 metrics):**
- Base Modules (B1-B3): 30 core metrics everyone needs
- Choose 1-2 additional modules (10-20 metrics) for YOUR pain point
- **Example:** Coffee shop picks Module T1-A (Beverage Focus) instead of Module T1-C (Full-Service Dining)

**Tier 2 (50-100 metrics):**
- Base Modules + 2-7 Professional modules
- **Example:** Multi-outlet restaurant adds P1 (Multi-Location Intelligence) + P3 (Menu Engineering)

**Think of it like ordering at your restaurant:**
- We don't force customers to order nasi goreng + pizza + steak
- They pick what they want today
- Same here: Pick modules for YOUR current priorities

**Bottom line:** Modular = you pay less AND get faster time-to-insight. More ≠ better."

**Follow-up close:**
"Which of your current challenges should we solve first? Revenue optimization? Staff performance? Food cost control? I'll recommend the right 2-3 modules."

---

### 17. "How do I know which modules I need?" (NEW - Modular Framework)

**Frequency:** Common (22% of Tier 1/2 prospects)

**Response:**

"Perfect question. I'll help you figure that out in 2 minutes with 3 questions:

**Question 1: What's your #1 pain point right now?**
- 'Revenue is flat' -> **Revenue Modules** (B1 Sales Analytics, T1-A Revenue Optimization)
- 'Food costs too high' -> **Cost Modules** (B2 Cost Analytics, T1-B Menu Engineering, P4 Supplier Intelligence)
- 'Staff turnover/performance' -> **People Modules** (B3 Staff Performance, P2 Labor Optimization)
- 'Don't know why customers aren't returning' -> **Customer Modules** (S1 Customer Retention, S2 Marketing Attribution)

**Question 2: What's your business model?**
- Coffee shop / QSR / food truck -> **T1-A (Beverage Focus)** + **T1-B (Takeout Optimization)**
- Full-service restaurant (dine-in) -> **T1-C (Full-Service)** + **P3 (Table Turn Analysis)**
- Multi-outlet / franchise -> **P1 (Multi-Location)** is a must-have
- Catering / delivery-heavy -> **S3 (Delivery Intelligence)**

**Question 3: How data-mature are you?**
- 'Just starting with analytics' -> **Base Modules only (30 metrics)** - Don't overwhelm yourself
- 'We track basics, want to go deeper' -> **Add 2-3 Professional modules (50-70 metrics)**
- 'We're data-driven, want everything' -> **Tier 3 (100-150 metrics)**

**I'll create a custom recommendation based on your answers. Most clients end up with 40-60 metrics (Base + 2-3 targeted modules).**

Want to do that quick diagnostic now?"

---

### 18. "Can I add more modules later?" (NEW - Modular Framework)

**Frequency:** Occasional (12%)

**Response:**

"Absolutely! That's the beauty of the modular framework.

**How Module Expansion Works:**

**Tier 1 (Essentials):**
- Start with 30-50 metrics (Base + 1-2 modules)
- Add modules later: **Rp 500K-1M per module** (one-time)
- **Or** upgrade to Tier 2 (pay difference: ~Rp 2-4M) to unlock Professional modules

**Tier 2 (Professional):**
- Start with 50-100 metrics (Base + 2-7 modules)
- Add more Professional modules: **Rp 750K-1.5M per module**
- Upgrade to Tier 3 (pay difference for setup) to get Strategic modules + ongoing support

**Tier 3 (Enterprise):**
- All 12 modules (100-150 metrics) included from day 1
- Monthly updates include new metrics as we develop them
- No additional module fees

**Recommended Path (Smart Approach):**

**Month 1-3:** Start with Base + 2 modules (40-50 metrics)
- Focus on mastering these
- Identify which metrics drive decisions
- Let your team get comfortable with the dashboard

**Month 4-6:** Add 1-2 more modules based on what you learned
- 'Oh, we really need customer retention tracking' -> Add Module S1
- 'Staff scheduling is killing us' -> Add Module P2 (Labor Optimization)

**Month 7-12:** Upgrade to Tier 3 if you're using 80%+ of what you have
- At this point, analytics is core to your operations
- Tier 3 managed setup makes sense

**Most successful clients start small, expand as they see ROI. You're not locked in to your initial choice."**

**Close:**
"Which approach sounds better: Start with everything (overwhelming) or start focused and expand based on results?"

---

## Objection Pattern Analysis

### By Tier:

**Tier 1 (Essentials - 30-50 metrics) objections:**
- "I can't set it up myself" -> Offer Tier 2
- "What if I break it?" -> Offer Tier 2/3
- "Which modules should I pick?" -> Module diagnostic (Objection #17)
- "What if I need more modules later?" -> Explain expansion path (Objection #18)

**Tier 2 (Professional - 50-100 metrics) objections:**
- "Still too expensive" -> Show ROI calculator, offer Tier 1 with fewer modules
- "I don't have time for setup call" -> Offer flexible scheduling
- "Too many module choices" -> Simplify to 3-4 recommended modules based on pain points

**Tier 3 (Enterprise - 100-150 metrics) objections:**
- "Too expensive for ongoing fees" -> Show cost vs hiring analyst (Rp 8-12M/month)
- "I don't need monthly updates" -> Downgrade to Tier 2
- "Why do I need all 12 modules?" -> Explain information completeness vs modular approach (Objection #16)

---

## Red Flags (When to Walk Away)

**Don't waste time if:**

1. **Revenue < Rp 2B/year** -> Too small, recommend free tools
2. **Not decision-maker and can't connect you to one** -> "Call me when owner is ready"
3. **Wants 50%+ discount** -> Not serious buyer
4. **Unclear pain point** -> They don't know what they need (not ready)
5. **Asks for 90-day free trial** -> Not how we sell (offer money-back guarantee instead)

**Polite exit:**
"It sounds like you're not quite ready for this yet. That's totally fine. Here's my card-when you're seriously looking to upgrade your analytics, give me a call. I'll still be here."

---

## Module-Specific Objections (Tier 2/3)

### "Why do I need modules? Can't you just give me everything?"

**Response:**
"Great question! We use modules for two reasons:

1. **You pay only for what you need** - Not every restaurant needs multi-outlet analytics if you have 1 location. Why pay for features you won't use?

2. **Focused implementation** - It's better to master 2-3 modules that solve your biggest pain points than to be overwhelmed with 150 metrics you don't understand.

Think of it like ordering à la carte vs buffet. Buffet sounds like better value, but you can't possibly eat everything. À la carte = you get exactly what you want, nothing wasted.

**Which of these sounds most valuable to you right now?**
- Multi-Outlet Operations (comparing location performance)
- Menu Optimization (finding which items are profitable)
- Workforce Analytics (staff performance tracking)
- Customer Mastery (loyalty and retention)"

---

### "How do I know which modules to pick?"

**Response:**
"Let me ask you 3 diagnostic questions:

1. **Biggest headache right now?**
 - Can't compare outlets -> Multi-Outlet Operations
 - Don't know which menu items are profitable -> Menu Optimization
 - Staff performance inconsistent -> Workforce Analytics
 - Losing repeat customers -> Customer Mastery

2. **Number of outlets?**
 - 1 outlet: Tier 1 is perfect, no modules needed yet
 - 2-3 outlets: Start with Multi-Outlet + 1 other
 - 5+ outlets: Tier 3 with all Strategic modules

3. **Team size?**
 - Solo/2 people: Tier 1 DIY
 - 3-10 staff: Tier 2 + Workforce module
 - 10+ staff: Tier 2/3 with full Workforce + Customer modules

Based on your answers, I'll recommend the exact modules. Most customers start with 1-2 modules (Rp 7-10M total) and add more later as they grow."

---

### "Can I add modules later?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely! In fact, we recommend starting lean. Here's how it works:

- **Start:** Tier 2 base (Rp 7M) with 50 metrics
- **Month 3:** Add Menu Optimization (+Rp 1.25M)
- **Month 6:** Add Workforce Analytics (+Rp 1.5M)
- **Total:** Rp 9.75M spread over 6 months vs Rp 9.75M upfront

**Better approach:**
1. Master base tier first (2-3 months)
2. Identify next bottleneck
3. Add relevant module
4. Repeat

Most successful customers add 1 module every 3-6 months as they scale. You're not locked in - modules unlock as you need them."

---

### "This modular pricing seems complicated. Just give me a flat price."

**Response:**
"I hear you. Let me simplify:

**Option 1: Simple (Tier 1) - Rp 4.5M**
- 40 core metrics, all the essentials
- Perfect for single-location restaurants
- No modules, no complexity

**Option 2: Professional (Tier 2) - Rp 9.5M**
- Everything in Tier 1 PLUS
- 2 most popular modules (Menu + Workforce)
- This is what 70% of customers choose

**Option 3: Complete (Tier 2 Max) - Rp 12M**
- All 4 Professional modules
- Nothing left to add
- 'Give me everything' option

If you just want me to pick for you: **Go with Option 2 (Rp 9.5M)** - it's the sweet spot for 2-3 outlet restaurants."

---

### "Competitor offers 150 metrics for Rp 5M flat. Why should I pay more?"

**Response:**
"Great, you're comparing! Let me show you the difference:

**Competitor (Rp 5M):**
- 150 metrics dumped into one dashboard
- Generic templates (you spend 8 hours formatting your data)
- No Excel templates, no Google Sheets, no ecosystem
- DIY setup, DIY support

**Us (Rp 7-12M modular):**
- 50-100 metrics YOU CHOOSE (not random 150)
- Pre-formatted Excel templates (30 min setup, not 8 hours)
- Complete ecosystem (Excel + Power BI + Sheets + Automation)
- 2-hour assisted setup call (we configure together)
- 90-day support included

**Real cost:**
- Competitor: Rp 5M product + 8 hours your time (Rp 100K/hour = Rp 800K) + ongoing frustration = **Rp 5.8M + headaches**
- Us: Rp 7M-12M all-in, setup done in 30 minutes, ongoing support = **Rp 7-12M peace of mind**

You're not paying more - you're paying for a solution that actually works vs a template you'll struggle with."

## Objection Handling Metrics

**Track these:**
- Most common objection by tier
- Objection -> close rate (which objections kill deals?)
- Response effectiveness (which scripts work best?)

**Goal:**
- 60%+ objection conversion rate (objection raised -> still closed)
- < 3 objections per call (if more, improve qualification)
