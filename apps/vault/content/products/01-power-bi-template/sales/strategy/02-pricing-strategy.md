## Executive Summary

### Pricing Philosophy

**Value-Based Pricing:** Price based on customer value realization, not cost-plus markup.

**Core Principle:** "Charge 10% of first-year value delivered"
- If customer saves/earns Rp 50M/year -> Price at Rp 5M (10%)
- ROI = 10x in Year 1, infinity from Year 2 onward (one-time purchase)

### Pricing Model

**One-Time Purchase (Default):** Pay once, own forever
- Tier 1: Rp 3.5-4.7M avg
- Tier 2: Rp 7-9.5M avg
- Tier 3: Rp 10-19.8M avg

**Optional Recurring:** Product 02 Support (Rp 400K-2M/month)

### Pricing Objectives (Sprint 1)

1. **Revenue:** Rp 470M from 100 customers (Rp 4.7M avg)
2. **Market Position:** Premium vs generic templates, affordable vs enterprise BI
3. **Customer Acquisition:** Low barrier (Tier 1 = entry point)
4. **Expansion Revenue:** 20% upgrade to Tier 2-3 within Year 1

---

## Part 2: Module Pricing (Add-Ons)

### 2.1 Module Strategy

**Philosophy:** Modular pricing allows customers to pay for what they need

**Benefits:**
- **Lower entry barrier:** Tier 1 base = Rp 3.5M (affordable), add modules later
- **Higher ACV:** Customers buy 1-2 modules avg -> Rp 4.7M total
- **Expansion revenue:** Sell modules post-purchase (upsell opportunity)

---

### 2.2 Module Catalog & Pricing

**Module Pricing:** Rp 1.25M each (flat rate for all modules)

| Module | What It Adds | Best For | Attach Rate |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Multi-Outlet Consolidation** | Aggregate 2-15 outlets in one dashboard | 2+ outlet businesses | 60% (Tier 1) |
| **Menu Engineering** | Profitability matrix (Stars, Dogs, etc.) | Struggling with menu pricing | 40% |
| **Customer Intelligence** | RFM segmentation, VIP tracking, churn risk | Loyalty program focus | 25% |
| **Inventory & COGS** | Stock tracking, supplier analysis, variance | High food cost issues | 30% |
| **Labor & Scheduling** | Shift optimization, productivity analysis | 10+ staff businesses | 20% |
| **Promotions & Marketing** | Campaign ROI, discount impact | Active marketing | 15% |
| **Forecasting** | 30/60/90-day revenue/cost predictions | Planning-focused | 10% |
| **Financial KPIs** | P&L, cash flow, break-even analysis | Finance-savvy owners | 10% |

**Pricing Rationale:** Rp 1.25M = 2-3 days analyst work (Rp 400K-600K/day × 2-3 days)

---

### 2.3 Module Bundling Discounts

**Not offered in Sprint 1** (keep pricing simple)

**Potential Future Bundling (Sprint 3+):**
- Buy 3 modules, get 4th free (Rp 5M for 4 modules instead of Rp 5M + Rp 1.25M)
- "Growth Package": Tier 1 + 3 popular modules = Rp 6M (save Rp 1.25M)

---

## Part 3: Pricing Psychology & Tactics

### 3.1 Anchoring Strategy

**Problem:** Rp 4.7M sounds expensive to SME F&B

**Solution:** Anchor to higher reference points

**Tactic 1: Analyst Replacement Anchor**
> "Hiring a junior analyst costs Rp 5-8M/month = Rp 60-96M/year. Our Tier 1 is Rp 4.7M one-time. That's 1 month of salary, but works forever. You save Rp 55-91M in Year 1 alone."

**Tactic 2: Time Savings Anchor**
> "You spend 4 hours/week on Excel = 16 hours/month. Your time is worth Rp 500K/hour (owner rate). That's Rp 8M/month. Tier 1 pays for itself in 18 days."

**Tactic 3: Competitor Anchor**
> "Generic Power BI templates cost Rp 500K-2M, but 60% of people fail to set up. Wasted money. We're 2-4x more expensive, but 92% setup success. Would you rather save Rp 2M and fail, or invest Rp 4.7M and succeed?"

---

### 3.2 Decoy Pricing (Tier 2 as Decoy)

**Classic 3-tier psychology:** Make Tier 2 look like the "best value"

**Visual Pricing Table:**

| Feature | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Price** | Rp 3.5M | **Rp 7M** | Rp 10M |
| **Metrics** | 30 | **70** | 100-150 |
| **Setup** | Self-service | **1:1 guided** | White-glove |
| **Support** | 14 days | **90 days** | Unlimited |
| **Multi-Outlet** | +Rp 1.25M | ** Included** | Included |
| **Best For** | Solo owner | **Growing business ** | Enterprise |

**Psychology:** Tier 2 is 2x price of Tier 1, but includes multi-outlet (worth Rp 1.25M) + 1:1 setup (worth Rp 2M) = Rp 3.25M value for Rp 3.5M incremental cost. "Best deal!"

**Result:** 40-50% choose Tier 2 (vs 30% if no decoy, 70% Tier 1)

---

### 3.3 Price Framing

**Bad Framing:**
> "Tier 1 costs Rp 4.7M"

**Good Framing:**
> "Tier 1 is Rp 4.7M - less than 1 month of a junior analyst (Rp 5-8M/month), but works forever"

**Better Framing:**
> "Tier 1 pays for itself in 18 days (based on time savings alone). After that, it's pure profit - you save Rp 8M/month, every month, forever."

---

### 3.4 Payment Terms & Installments

**Default:** Full payment upfront (bank transfer)

**Optional (to close deals):** 2-3 installments

**Tier 1 Installment Example:**
- Rp 4.7M total
- Option A: Rp 2.5M upfront, Rp 2.2M in 30 days
- Option B: Rp 1.6M × 3 months (no interest)

**Conditions:**
- Only for Tier 2-3 (Tier 1 too small to offer installments)
- Installments approved case-by-case (sales lead approval)
- Product access granted after 1st payment, but locked if 2nd payment late

---

## Part 4: Discounting Policy

### 4.1 When to Discount (Sparingly)

**General Rule:** Don't discount in Sprint 1 (establish price anchoring first)

**Exceptions (Sprint 1):**
1. **Early-bird discount:** First 20 customers get 10% off (Rp 4.7M -> Rp 4.2M)
2. **Referral discount:** Rp 500K off if referred by existing customer

**Future Discounting (Sprint 2+):**
3. **Bulk/partnership:** 5+ licenses for chain/franchise = 15% off per license
4. **Annual prepay (Product 02):** Pay 12 months upfront = 2 months free

---

### 4.2 What NOT to Discount

**Never Discount:**
- Tier 1 base price below Rp 3M (cheapens perceived value)
- Just because customer asks (train sales team to defend price with value)
- To match "competitor" generic templates (different product, higher success rate)

**Why No Race to Bottom:**
- We compete on value (92% setup success, F&B-specific), not price
- Cheap customers churn faster (don't value product)
- Discounting trains market to expect discounts

---

### 4.3 Discount Approval Matrix

| Discount % | Amount (Tier 1) | Who Can Approve |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **0-10%** | Rp 0-470K | Sales Rep |
| **11-20%** | Rp 471K-940K | Sales Lead |
| **21-30%** | Rp 941K-1.4M | Founder approval |
| **>30%** | >Rp 1.4M | Never (reject deal) |

**Rationale:** >30% discount = unprofitable customer (COGS + CAC > revenue)

---

## Part 5: Competitor Pricing Benchmarking

### 5.1 Competitive Landscape

**Competitor 1: Generic Power BI Templates (Envato, Gumroad)**

| Metric | Generic Templates | Our Product 01 | Our Advantage |
|--------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Price** | Rp 500K-2M | Rp 3.5-12M | 2-6x more expensive |
| **What's Included** | .pbix file only | .pbix + Excel + Training + Support | Complete ecosystem |
| **Setup Success** | 40% | 92% | 2.3x higher success |
| **F&B-Specific** | No (generic) | Yes (30-150 F&B metrics) | Industry tailored |
| **Support** | None | 14-90 days | Not abandoned |

**Pricing Strategy vs Generic:**
- Price 2-6x higher, but justify with 2.3x setup success + F&B specificity
- Target customers who tried generic and failed (60% of market)

---

**Competitor 2: POS Built-In Analytics (Moka, Pawoon)**

| Metric | POS Analytics | Our Product 01 | Our Advantage |
|--------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Price** | Free (included with POS) | Rp 3.5-12M | Infinitely more expensive |
| **Metrics Count** | 5-10 basic | 30-150 advanced | 6-30x more metrics |
| **Multi-POS** | Locked to one POS | Works with any POS | Not vendor-locked |
| **Deep Analysis** | No (surface-level) | Yes (menu engineering, forecasting) | Strategic insights |

**Pricing Strategy vs POS:**
- Can't compete on price (they're free)
- Compete on depth: "POS analytics show WHAT happened, we show WHY and WHAT TO DO"
- Position as upgrade, not replacement

---

**Competitor 3: Hiring Junior Analyst**

| Metric | Junior Analyst | Our Product 01 (Tier 1) | Our Advantage |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Cost** | Rp 5-8M/month = Rp 60-96M/year | Rp 4.7M one-time | 92-95% cheaper |
| **Speed to Value** | 3-6 months ramp | <24 hours | Instant value |
| **HR Burden** | High (recruit, manage, train) | Zero | No management |
| **Churn Risk** | High (turnover 30-50%/year) | Zero | Works forever |
| **Specialization** | Generalist | F&B specialist (built-in expertise) | Domain knowledge |

**Pricing Strategy vs Analyst:**
- Price at "1 month salary" (Rp 4.7M ≈ 1 month Rp 5M analyst)
- ROI message: "Get analyst-level insights for 1 month salary, not 12 months"

---

**Competitor 4: Enterprise BI (Tableau, Qlik)**

| Metric | Enterprise BI | Our Product 01 (Tier 3) | Our Advantage |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Price** | Rp 3-5M/month = Rp 36-60M/year | Rp 10-12M one-time | 66-80% cheaper (Year 1) |
| **Setup Complexity** | 3-6 months, needs consultant | 3-5 days white-glove | 30x faster |
| **Learning Curve** | Steep (requires training) | Gentle (F&B-specific, pre-built) | Easier |
| **Target Market** | Enterprise (100+ outlets) | SME (1-15 outlets) | Right-sized |

**Pricing Strategy vs Enterprise BI:**
- Don't directly compete (different market segments)
- Position as "right-sized for SME" (Tableau overkill for 5 outlets)

---

## Part 6: Pricing Experiments & Optimization

### 6.1 Sprint 1 Pricing (Fixed)

**No experiments in Sprint 1** - establish baseline

**Pricing:**
- Tier 1: Rp 3.5M (base), Rp 4.7M (avg with modules)
- Tier 2: Rp 7M (base), Rp 9.5M (avg with modules)
- Tier 3: Rp 10M (base), Rp 12.5M (avg)

**Metrics to Track:**
- Avg selling price (ASP) per tier
- Module attach rate
- Discount rate (% of deals discounted, avg discount %)
- Win rate by tier
- Time to close by tier

---

### 6.2 Sprint 2 Pricing Experiments

**Experiment 1: Tier 1 Price Increase (+15%)**

**Hypothesis:** Rp 3.5M is too cheap (95% margin, selling too easily)

**Test:** Increase Tier 1 base to Rp 4M (Rp 3.5M -> Rp 4M)

**Success Metrics:**
- Win rate stays >60% (if drops to <50%, revert)
- ASP increases to Rp 5.2M (from Rp 4.7M)
- Customer objections don't increase (monitor sales calls)

---

**Experiment 2: Tier 2 Decoy Enhancement**

**Hypothesis:** Can push more customers to Tier 2 by making Tier 1 less attractive

**Test:** Remove Multi-Outlet Module from Tier 1 add-ons (force Tier 2 purchase)

**Success Metrics:**
- Tier 2 mix increases to 35% (from 25%)
- Overall revenue increases (fewer Tier 1, more Tier 2)

---

**Experiment 3: Annual Subscription Option (Product 02 Bundling)**

**Hypothesis:** Some customers prefer subscription over one-time (cash flow management)

**Test:** Offer "Tier 1 Annual" = Rp 1.5M/month × 12 months = Rp 18M/year
- Includes Tier 1 product + Product 02 Basic support
- Compare to one-time Tier 1 (Rp 4.7M) + Product 02 (Rp 400K/month × 12 = Rp 4.8M) = Rp 9.5M

**Positioning:** Annual = 2x cost, but includes ongoing support (worth it for busy owners)

**Success Metrics:**
- 10-15% choose Annual option
- Retention >85% (subscription customers stay)

---

---

### 7.2 Sales Pitch Script (Pricing Reveal)

**Step 1: Build Value First (Before Showing Price)**

> "Before we talk price, let me show you what this solves:
> 1. You're spending 4 hours/week on Excel = Rp 8M/month in your time
> 2. Our beta customers discovered avg Rp 2.4M/month in savings (food cost, theft, inefficiency)
> 3. That's Rp 10.4M/month in combined value, or Rp 125M/year.
>
> If we could deliver just 10% of that value - Rp 12.5M/year - would it be worth investing?"

**Step 2: Anchor to Alternatives**

> "Most businesses solve this by hiring a junior analyst. That costs Rp 5-8M/month, or Rp 60-96M/year. And they take 3-6 months to ramp up.
>
> Our solution costs 1 month of analyst salary, but works from Day 1 and lasts forever."

**Step 3: Reveal Pricing (Start with Tier 2 as Anchor)**

> "We have three tiers. Most growing businesses like yours choose Tier 2 Professional:
> - Tier 2 is Rp 7M one-time (avg Rp 9.5M with add-ons you'll likely want)
> - Includes 70 metrics, multi-outlet consolidation, 1:1 setup call, 90-day support
> - Pays for itself in 14-21 days based on beta customer results
>
> We also have Tier 1 at Rp 3.5M if you're DIY-comfortable and only have 1 outlet.
>
> And Tier 3 at Rp 10M+ if you need white-label branding and white-glove service.
>
> Based on your business (3 outlets, want guided setup), I'd recommend Tier 2. Does that fit your budget?"

---

### 7.3 Objection Handling (Pricing)

**Objection 1: "That's too expensive"**

**Response:**
> "I hear you - Rp 4.7M is not cheap. Let me put it in perspective:
> - You're spending 4 hours/week on Excel. That's Rp 8M/month in your time (at Rp 500K/hour owner rate).
> - This pays for itself in 18 days just from time savings.
> - After that, you save Rp 8M/month, every month, forever.
> - Over 1 year, that's Rp 96M saved for a Rp 4.7M investment. That's a 20x ROI.
>
> Is the issue the upfront cost, or do you not believe you'll get that value?"

**If upfront cost:** Offer 2-3 installments (Tier 2-3 only)

**If don't believe value:** Share beta case study, offer 30-day money-back guarantee

---

**Objection 2: "Can I get a discount?"**

**Response (if qualify):**
> "We do have an early-bird offer for our first 20 customers - 10% off, which brings Tier 1 to Rp 4.2M instead of Rp 4.7M."

**Response (if don't qualify):**
> "Our pricing is pretty fixed because we've priced it at 10% of the value we deliver. If I gave you 20% off (Rp 3.8M instead of Rp 4.7M), you'd still save Rp 96M/year from time savings alone. That's a 25x ROI instead of 20x.
>
> The question isn't 'Is Rp 3.8M better than Rp 4.7M?' - of course it is. The question is 'Will you invest Rp 4.7M to save Rp 96M?' If yes, let's move forward. If no, this isn't a price issue - it's a value issue, and I'd rather address that."

---

**Objection 3: "I can get a Power BI template for Rp 500K on Envato"**

**Response:**
> "You're right - there are cheaper templates out there. Here's the difference:
> 1. **Setup success:** 60% of people who buy those templates fail to set up. You waste Rp 500K and 8 hours trying. We have 92% setup success.
> 2. **F&B-specific:** Those are generic business templates. We have 30 F&B-specific metrics (food cost %, menu engineering, etc.) that you won't find anywhere else.
> 3. **Support:** Those templates, you're on your own. We give you 14-90 days of support.
>
> Would you rather save Rp 4M and have a 60% chance of failure, or invest Rp 4.7M and have a 92% chance of success?"
