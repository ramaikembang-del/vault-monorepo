# Pre-Sale Validation Playbook - Complete F&B Data Ecosystem

**Product:** A1 - Power BI + Excel/Sheets Bundle (3-Tier Ecosystem)
**Purpose:** Validate market demand BEFORE investing 3-4 weeks building
**Philosophy:** "Sell first, build second" - De-risk product development
**Timeline:** Week 0 (1-2 weeks validation) -> Decision Gate -> Week 1-4 (Build if validated)

---

## ECOSYSTEM BUNDLE VALIDATION FOCUS

**What We're Validating:**
- NOT just "Will they buy a Power BI template?"
- BUT "Will they buy a complete data system (Excel + Power BI + automation)?"

**Key Discovery Questions:**
1. **"How do you currently track sales data? Excel?"**
 - If Excel: "You'd keep using Excel, just upgrade insights. Interested?"
 - Validates: Excel + Power BI symbiosis positioning

2. **"Have you tried Power BI templates before?"**
 - If Failed: "60% fail due to CSV format. Our Excel templates solve that."
 - Validates: Our key differentiator resonates

3. **"Would your staff use Power BI?"**
 - Expected: "No/too technical"
 - Response: "Correct! Staff use Excel (familiar), owner uses Power BI."
 - Validates: Separation of concerns (staff input, owner insights)

**Pricing Validation:**
- Show: "Rp 5M value (Power BI + 4 Excel templates + videos + automation)"
- Offer: "Early access Rp 2M (60% off)"
- Tests: Bundle value perception vs template-only pricing

---

## Why Validate Before Building?

**The Problem with "Build-First":**
- Œ 3-4 weeks sunk cost if nobody wants it
- Œ Might build wrong features (what YOU think vs what THEY need)
- Œ No cash flow while building (burning savings)
- Œ Feature bloat risk (adding things customers don't care about)

**The Power of "Validate-First":**
- Zero build risk if market says "no"
- Customer co-creation (build what they ACTUALLY want)
- Cash upfront (deposits fund development)
- Faster pivot if wrong (1 week validation vs 4 weeks build)

---

## Week 0: Pre-Sale Validation Phase

### Goal: Get 3-5 Commitment Signals Before Building

**Success Criteria:**
- **Minimum:** 3 verbal commitments ("Yes, I'd buy this for Rp 2.5M")
- **Ideal:** 5 deposit commitments (50% = Rp 1.25M per customer = Rp 6.25M upfront)
- **Stretch:** 10 waitlist signups (indicates broader market interest)

---

## Step 1: Create Validation Assets (Day 1-2)

### A. One-Page Sales Document

**Use existing:** `marketing/one-pager.md` as template

**Adapt for validation:**
- Keep: Problem, solution, pricing, ROI
- Add: "EARLY ACCESS OFFER" banner
- Add: Mockup screenshots (borrow from similar dashboards)
- Add: Delivery timeline ("3-4 weeks from commitment")
- Add: Scarcity ("First 5 customers only")

**Label mockups clearly:**
```
[Screenshot: Sample Dashboard - Your Actual Dashboard Will Look Like This]
```

**Early Access Offer:**
```
 EARLY ACCESS PRICING (First 5 Customers Only)
- Tier 1 (Essentials): Rp 3.5-6M (30-50 metrics)
- Tier 2 (Professional): Rp 7-12M (50-100 metrics)
- Tier 3 (Enterprise): Rp 10-15M (100-150 metrics)

Commitment: 50% deposit now, 50% upon delivery (3-4 weeks)
```

---

### B. Validation Landing Page (Optional but Recommended)

**Minimal viable landing page:**
- Hero: "Stop Wasting 4 Hours/Week on Excel. Get Your Custom F&B Dashboard."
- Problem section: Data chaos, manual reports, no insights
- Solution: 75 pre-built metrics, 3 tabs, POS-integrated
- Mockup screenshots (3-5 images)
- Pricing: Early access Rp 2M (vs Rp 2.5M standard)
- CTA: "Reserve Your Spot (Rp 1M Deposit)"
- Trust signals: Your credentials, F&B expertise, Power BI certification

**Tools:**
- Carrd.co (quick 1-page sites)
- Google Sites (free, simple)
- Notion public page (even simpler)

**Timeline:** 2-4 hours to create

---

### C. Borrowed Mockups/Screenshots

**Where to Get:**
1. **Google Images:** "Power BI F&B dashboard" "restaurant analytics dashboard"
2. **Power BI Gallery:** community.powerbi.com (filter by retail/F&B)
3. **Your Own Sketches:** Hand-drawn wireframes on iPad/tablet
4. **Canva:** Create mockup visuals (use their dashboard templates)

**Critical:** Label all as "Sample" or "Mockup" - be transparent

**What to Show:**
- Tab 1: Command Center (revenue, costs, profit overview)
- Tab 2: Wolf Pack (staff performance, labor costs)
- Tab 3: Loyalty Loop (customer metrics, repeat rate)

---

## Step 2: Outreach & Validation Conversations (Day 3-7)

### Target: 15-20 Conversations -> 3-5 Commitments

### A. Warm Network (Start Here)

**Who:**
- F&B owners you know personally
- LinkedIn connections in F&B
- Facebook group members (F&B owners Indonesia)
- WhatsApp contacts (restaurant managers, cafe owners)

**Channel:** WhatsApp (most effective in Indonesia)

**Message Template:**
```
Hi [Name]!

Quick question: Berapa lama waktu yang kamu spend setiap minggu untuk analisa data penjualan/laporan?

Aku lagi develop Power BI dashboard khusus untuk F&B (kayak [your restaurant type]). 75 metrics otomatis, integrated dengan POS kamu.

Ini mockup-nya: [attach PDF/images]

Worth Rp 2.5M? Atau too much?

Kalau ini ready dalam 3-4 minggu, would you buy for Rp 2M (early access discount)?

Appreciate honest feedback!
```

**Follow-Up Questions:**
- "What reports do you currently track?" (validate metrics)
- "What's most painful about your current process?" (find pain points)
- "Which POS do you use?" (confirm integration compatibility)
- "How much do you spend on bookkeeper/accountant per month?" (anchor pricing)

---

### B. Cold Outreach (If Warm Network < 15 People)

**LinkedIn:**
- Search: "restaurant owner jakarta" "cafe owner indonesia" "fnb manager"
- Connection request: "Fellow F&B entrepreneur, would love to connect"
- After accepted: Send validation message (softer approach)

**Facebook Groups:**
- "Pengusaha Kuliner Indonesia"
- "F&B Business Indonesia"
- "Restaurant Owners Jakarta"
- Post: "Creating F&B analytics dashboard. Looking for 3-5 beta testers. Who's interested?"

**Instagram:**
- DM cafe/restaurant owners with engaged following
- "Love your concept! Are you tracking your data systematically?"

---

### C. Validation Conversation Scripts

#### **Script 1: Discovery**

<YOU>: "How do you currently track your business performance?"

<THEM>: [Excel / POS reports / Accountant / Nothing systematic]

<YOU>: "What takes the most time in that process?"

<THEM>: [Manual entry / Consolidating data / Creating reports]

<YOU>: "If I could cut that time from 4 hours to 30 seconds per week, and give you 75 metrics auto-updated, what would that be worth?"

<THEM>: [Price anchor or interest signal]

---

#### **Script 2: The Ask**

<YOU>: "I'm building exactly that - Power BI dashboard with 75 pre-built metrics for F&B. Integrated with your POS (Moka/Pawoon/Qasir). Updates in real-time."

<YOU>: [Show mockup screenshots]

<YOU>: "Normal price will be Rp 2.5M. But for first 5 customers, I'm offering Rp 2M. It'll be ready in 3-4 weeks."

<YOU>: "Would you commit with Rp 1M deposit now, Rp 1M upon delivery? Or is this not a priority?"

---

#### **Script 3: Objection Handling**

**Objection:** "Rp 2M is too expensive"

<RESPONSE>: "Fair. What's your current process costing? [Wait for answer]. If your manager spends 4 hours per week @ Rp 50K/hour, that's Rp 800K per month = Rp 9.6M per year. This dashboard pays for itself in 3 months."

---

**Objection:** "I don't trust it'll work"

<RESPONSE>: "I get it. That's why I'm only asking for 50% deposit. If I don't deliver in 4 weeks, full refund. Plus I'll show you progress screenshots every week. Sound fair?"

---

**Objection:** "Can I see a demo first?"

<RESPONSE>: "That's the thing - it doesn't exist yet! That's why early access is Rp 2M instead of Rp 2.5M. You're funding the development. But here's what it'll look like [show mockups]. And here's exactly what 75 metrics you'll get [show list]."

---

**Objection:** "Let me think about it"

<RESPONSE>: "Absolutely. Just FYI, I'm only taking 5 early customers. Currently 2 slots left [create urgency]. Can I follow up with you in 2 days? Or would you prefer I check back next week?"

---

## Step 3: Track Validation Metrics (Throughout Week 0)

### Validation Scorecard

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Conversations conducted | 15-20 | ___ | |
| Positive interest ("I'd consider it") | 10 | ___ | |
| Verbal commitments ("Yes, I'd buy") | 3-5 | ___ | |
| Deposit commitments (50% upfront) | 3 | ___ | |
| Waitlist signups (no deposit) | 10 | ___ | |

**Update daily.** Track in spreadsheet or Notion.

---

### Qualitative Feedback Log

**Document every conversation:**

| Name | Business Type | Feedback | Interest Level | Next Step |
|------|---------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Budi | Cafe (2 outlets) | "Need multi-location view" | High | Follow up 2 days |
| Siti | Warung | "Too expensive for me" | Low | Not a fit |
| Andi | Restaurant | "Love it, when ready?" | High | Collect deposit |

**Insights to capture:**
- What features did they ask about? (validation of metrics catalog)
- What objections came up repeatedly? (refine messaging)
- What's their current pain level 1-10? (qualify urgency)
- What POS do they use? (confirm integration roadmap)

---

## Step 4: Decision Gate (End of Week 0)

### Decision Framework

#### **Scenario A: Strong Validation (Proceed to Build)**

**Criteria:**
- 3+ verbal commitments OR
- 2+ deposit commitments (Rp 2M+ in hand) OR
- 10+ waitlist signups

**Action:**
1. Proceed to build (Week 1-4)
2. Send update to committed customers: "You're in! Starting development. Week 1 update coming Friday."
3. Begin Tier 1 Launch Checklist (operations/)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Build with confidence
- Deliver to 3-5 pre-sold customers
- Get testimonials from validated customers
- Scale to broader market

---

#### **Scenario B: Weak Validation (Pivot or Pause)**

**Criteria:**
- Œ 0-2 verbal commitments
- Œ 0 deposits
- Œ <5 waitlist signups

**Action:**
1. ¸ **Pause building**
2. **Investigate:** Why low interest?
 - Pricing too high? (test Rp 1.5M)
 - Value prop unclear? (rewrite messaging)
 - Wrong target market? (try different segment)
 - Timing wrong? (end of year, cash tight?)
3. **Pivot Options:**
 - **Option 1:** Simplify to Tier 1 only (DIY template, Rp 1.5M)
 - **Option 2:** Offer free pilot (1 customer, build custom, learn deeply)
 - **Option 3:** Delay launch to Q1 2025 (better F&B cash flow timing)
 - **Option 4:** Build E1 SaaS instead (recurring revenue more attractive?)

**Critical:** Don't build if market says "no"

---

#### **Scenario C: Mixed Signals (Investigate Further)**

**Criteria:**
- 2 verbal commitments (close to threshold)
- 5-9 waitlist signups (interest but not strong)
- Positive feedback but no money commitments

**Action:**
1. **Extend validation 1 more week** (reach 10 more people)
2. **Offer different pricing tier:**
 - "Too expensive at Rp 2M? What about Rp 1.5M for simplified version (50 metrics instead of 75)?"
3. **Test urgency:**
 - "I'm starting build next Monday. Last chance for early access pricing."
4. Re-evaluate at end of Week 1

---

## Step 5: Communicate Results (End of Week 0)

### To Committed Customers

**If proceeding to build:**
```

**If pausing/pivoting:**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick update: After talking to 15 F&B owners, I learned [key insight from validation].

I'm adjusting the product to [what you're changing].

Still interested when it's ready? Or would you prefer Rp 1M refund (if you paid deposit)?

Appreciate your early support!

- [Your Name]
```

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Œ Don't Do This:

1. **Validation theater** - Going through motions but ignoring "no" signals
 - Fix: Be brutally honest. If market says "meh," don't build.

2. **Asking leading questions** - "This is amazing, right?" "You'd definitely buy this?"
 - Fix: Neutral questions. "Would you pay Rp 2M for this? Or is that too much?"

3. **Fake urgency** - "Only 5 slots!" when you don't have any commitments
 - Fix: True scarcity. If 2 commit, say "3 slots left" (true).

4. **Over-promising** - "I'll build 200 metrics!" when you planned 75
 - Fix: Under-promise, over-deliver. Stick to planned scope.

5. **Ignoring feedback** - Building what YOU want, not what THEY need
 - Fix: If 5 people say "I don't need X feature," don't build X.

---

## Next Steps After Validation

### If Validated: Proceed to Build

1. Update [[products/01-power-bi-template/operations/03-tier-1-launch-checklist|Tier 1 Launch Checklist]] - Mark "Week 0 Validation" complete
2. Begin Week 1-4 build phase
3. Send weekly updates to committed customers
4. Track/document learnings for future products

### If Not Validated: Pivot or Pause

1. ¸ Document why (learnings for next product)
2. Pivot approach (pricing, features, target market)
3. Analyze feedback deeply (what DID resonate?)
4. Consider alternative product (E1 SaaS? Different template?)

---

## Conclusion

**The pre-sale validation phase is 1-2 weeks that saves 3-4 weeks of wasted build time.**

**Remember:**
- You're not trying to "convince" people to buy something they don't want
- You're discovering if market ALREADY wants what you plan to build
- If they say "yes" -> Build with confidence
- If they say "no" -> Pivot fast, fail cheap

**"The market is always right. Your assumptions are always wrong until validated."**
