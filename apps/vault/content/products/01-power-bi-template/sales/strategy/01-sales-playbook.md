---

### 2.2 Lead Sources (Sprint 1)

**Source 1: Warm Network (50% of leads)**

**Who:**
- Personal connections in F&B
- Friends who own café/restaurants
- Previous consulting clients
- LinkedIn 1st-degree connections

**Outreach Method:** Direct WhatsApp/LinkedIn message

**Template Message:**
```
Hi [Name]!

Quick question - are you still using Excel to track your [café/restaurant] data?

I just launched a Power BI template specifically for F&B businesses in Indonesia.
Makes reporting automatic - literally 10 minutes vs 4 hours/week.

Beta customers are seeing ROI in <30 days (one guy saved Rp 2M/month discovering
food cost issues he didn't know existed).

Worth a 15-min chat? No pressure, just thought of you.

- [Your Name]
```

**Conversion Rate:** 40-50% (warm leads respond well)

---

**Source 2: F&B Facebook Groups (30% of leads)**

**Target Groups:**
- "Komunitas Pemilik Restoran Indonesia" (15K members)
- "Café & Coffee Shop Indonesia" (8K members)
- "Moka POS Users" (5K members)
- "Pawoon Community" (3K members)

**Outreach Strategy:** Educational content + soft sell

**Sample Post:**
```
[EDUCATIONAL POST - Not spammy]

Fellow F&B owners - quick poll

How many hours do you spend per week on:
1. Excel reports / manual data entry
2. Analyzing your menu performance
3. Checking food cost / labor cost

Comment below!

(Context: I'm building analytics tools for Indonesian F&B businesses,
genuinely curious what everyone's doing)
```

**Follow-up (in comments):**
When someone replies "4-8 hours/week", reply:
```
Wow, 4-8 hours is a lot! Have you tried Power BI or any BI tools?

I just built a template specifically for Indonesian cafés/restaurants.
Automates most of that. DM me if you want to see a demo
(beta customers cut that time to <30 min/week).
```

**Conversion Rate:** 5-8% (cold audience, lower intent)

---

**Source 3: LinkedIn Outreach (15% of leads)**

**Target Profile:**
- Job title: Owner, Co-Founder, GM, Operations Manager

Hi [Name],

I see you're the [Owner/GM] at [Business Name] - love the concept!

I work with F&B businesses on data analytics (helping café/restaurant owners
make sense of their POS data without spending hours in Excel).

Would love to connect and learn about your business.

- [Your Name]
```

**Follow-up (after connection accepted):**
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

Out of curiosity - how are you currently tracking your revenue,
food cost, and menu performance? Excel, POS built-in reports, or something else?

(I'm building analytics tools for Indonesian F&B, always learning from operators like you)
```

**Conversion Rate:** 10-15% (professional context, qualified audience)

---

Quick ask: Do you know any café/restaurant owner friends who struggle with
data/reporting like you used to?

If you refer someone and they buy:
- They get Rp 500K off
- You get Rp 1M credit (cash or toward upgrades)

Just intro me via WhatsApp/email. No pressure!

Thanks!
- [Your Name]
```

**Conversion Rate:** 80% (referrals are pre-qualified, high trust)

---

### 2.3 Lead Qualification (BANT Framework)

**Before spending time on discovery call, qualify leads:**

**B - Budget**
- Can they afford Rp 3.5-12M one-time purchase?
- Ask: "What's your typical monthly revenue?" (If <Rp 40M/month, likely can't afford Tier 1)
- Red flag: "I need to ask my wife/husband for approval" (may not have decision authority)

**A - Authority**
- Are they the decision-maker?
- Ask: "Who else would need to approve this purchase?"
- Green flag: "I'm the owner, I decide" or "I own 100% equity"
- Yellow flag: "I need to check with my business partner" (still worth pursuing)
- Red flag: "I need board approval" (Tier 3 enterprise, longer sales cycle)

**N - Need**
- Do they have a clear pain?
- Ask: "How are you currently tracking your F&B data?"
- Green flag: "I spend 4+ hours/week on Excel" or "I don't track anything, I should"
- Red flag: "I'm happy with my POS built-in reports" (low pain = hard sell)

**T - Timeline**
- When do they need this?
- Ask: "What's prompting you to look at analytics solutions now?"
- Green flag: "Investor meeting next month" or "Auditor asked for reports last week" (urgent)
- Yellow flag: "Just exploring" (nurture, not immediate sale)

**Qualification Scorecard:**

| Criteria | Green (3 pts) | Yellow (2 pts) | Red (1 pt) |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Budget** | Revenue >Rp 50M/month | Rp 20-50M/month | <Rp 20M/month |
| **Authority** | Owner, 100% decision | Partner approval needed | Board/committee approval |
| **Need** | Spends 4+ hrs/week on Excel | Has pain, not urgent | Happy with current setup |
| **Timeline** | Need this week/month | Exploring, 1-3 months | No timeline |

**Scoring:**
- **10-12 points:** High-priority lead (schedule discovery call immediately)
- **7-9 points:** Medium-priority (nurture, schedule call within 2 weeks)
- **4-6 points:** Low-priority (add to email nurture sequence, don't prioritize)

## Part 3: Discovery Call Process

### 3.1 Pre-Call Preparation (5-10 min)

**Before every discovery call:**

- [ ] Research prospect's business (Google their café/restaurant, check Instagram)
- [ ] Check if they have reviews (Google, GoFood, GrabFood) - note: food quality, service issues
- [ ] LinkedIn research (understand their background, how long in F&B)
- [ ] Prepare custom questions based on business type (café vs restaurant vs bakery)

**Example Prep Notes:**
```
Prospect: Dimas, Coffee Shop ABC
Business: Single café in Jakarta Selatan, opened 2023
Instagram: 5K followers, posts daily (active marketing)
Reviews: 4.5 stars Google (23 reviews), complaints about "inconsistent coffee quality"
LinkedIn: Dimas worked in corporate before, quit to open café (F&B newbie)

**Custom angle:** Emphasize food cost control (coffee beans = high cost item),
quality consistency tracking (staff performance metrics)
```

---

### 3.2 Discovery Call Agenda (30-45 min)

**Opening (5 min) - Build Rapport**

Script:
```
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time!

Before we dive in, I saw [specific observation from research - e.g. your Instagram,
your café looks amazing! The latte art is ]. How long have you been in the F&B business?"

[Listen - let them talk about their journey, build connection]

"That's awesome. Okay, so this call - my goal is to understand your current
data/reporting situation and see if our Power BI template might help.

I'll ask a bunch of questions (probably too many questions ),
then I'll explain how it works and we can decide if it's a fit. Sound good?"
```

**Key Moves:**
- Compliment their business (genuine, specific)
- Let them talk (people love talking about their business)
- Set agenda (manage expectations)

---

**Discovery Questions (25 min) - Uncover Pain**

**Q1: Current State**
```
"Walk me through how you currently track your revenue, food cost, and menu performance.
What does that process look like?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Excel (manual, time-consuming)
- POS built-in reports (limited, not customizable)
- Nothing (flying blind, gut feel)
- Accountant does it (disconnected from operations)

**Follow-up:**
"How much time does that take per week? And who's responsible for it - you or staff?"

---

**Q2: Pain Point**
```
"What frustrates you most about your current setup?"
```

**Common Answers:**
- "Takes forever" (time waste)
- "Hard to understand" (too much data, no insights)
- "Always out of date" (data lag)
- "Can't trust the numbers" (manual errors)

**Amplify the pain:**
"So if I'm understanding correctly, you're spending [X hours/week] on this,
and you STILL don't feel confident in the numbers? That must be frustrating."

---

**Q3: Impact of Problem**
```
"What's the cost of NOT having good data? Has it led to any bad decisions or missed opportunities?"
```

**Examples they might share:**
- Ordered too much inventory -> waste
- Didn't notice food cost creeping up -> lost profit
- Kept unprofitable menu items -> dragging down margins
- Hired too many staff -> labor cost spike

**Note-taking:** Write down specific dollar amounts ("Lost Rp 3M last month on wasted ingredients")

---

**Q4: Previous Attempts**
```
"Have you tried any other analytics tools or BI software before?"
```

**If yes:**
"What happened? Why didn't it work out?"

**Common answers:**
- "Tried Power BI template from Envato, couldn't figure out setup" (we solve this with Excel templates)
- "Looked at Tableau, too expensive" (we're cheaper)
- "POS vendor offers analytics, too basic" (we're F&B-specific, 30-150 metrics)

**Frame our solution:**
"Got it. So the issue was [their problem]. That's exactly what we built this to solve."

---

**Q5: Ideal Solution**
```
"If you could wave a magic wand, what would the perfect analytics solution look like for you?"
```

**Listen for:**
- "Automated" (we have one-click refresh)
- "Easy to understand" (we have visual dashboards, not Excel tables)
- "F&B-specific" (we have 30-150 F&B metrics)
- "Affordable" (we're Rp 3.5-12M one-time, not Rp 5M/month)

**Confirm fit:**
"Interesting! So you want [repeat their wish list]. Actually, that's pretty much what we built."

---

**Q6: Budget & Authority**
```
"If we can solve [their pain], what would you be comfortable investing?
Our tiers range from Rp 3.5M to Rp 12M one-time, no subscription."
```

**If hesitation:**
"I know that might sound like a lot. But if it saves you [X hours/week] at [their hourly rate],
it pays back in [Y weeks]. Or if it helps you catch a Rp 2M food cost issue like our other customer,
it pays back immediately."

**Authority check:**
"And just to confirm - you're the one who makes this decision, or do you need to run it by anyone?"

---

**Solution Presentation (10 min) - Tailored Pitch**

**Don't pitch features. Pitch THEIR solution to THEIR problem.**

```
"Okay, based on what you shared, here's how this would work for you:

THEIR PROBLEM: You're spending [4 hours/week] on Excel, and you still don't know which menu items are profitable.

OUR SOLUTION:
- You'd fill out a simple Excel template (5-10 min/day, your staff can do it)
- Click one button in Power BI (literally one button)
- Dashboard updates with all your data
- You instantly see: Top 10 items, food cost %, profit margin per item

TIME SAVED: 4 hours/week -> 10 minutes/week (97% time reduction)

VALUE: Our beta customer [Dimas] discovered his food cost was 37% (should be 30%).
He fixed it, now saves Rp 2.1M/month. Investment paid back in 23 days.

FOR YOU: If you catch even ONE issue like that, this pays for itself immediately.

What do you think?"
```

---

**Objection Handling (Built-In)**

**Objection 1: "Sounds complicated"**

Response:
```
"I hear you. That's why we built the Excel templates.

You don't need to learn Power BI. Your staff just fills Excel (they already know Excel).
You click one button. That's it.

Our beta customers had 100% setup success. Compare that to generic Power BI templates -
60% FAIL because setup is too hard.

Want me to show you the Excel template? Takes 2 min."
```

---

**Objection 2: "Too expensive"**

Response:
```
"Fair question. Let's do the math.

You said you spend [4 hours/week] on Excel. That's 16 hours/month.

What's your time worth? Let's say Rp 500K/hour (owner rate).
16 hours × Rp 500K = Rp 8M/month in your time.

Our Tier 1 is Rp 4-5M ONE-TIME.
So you pay ONCE what you waste in HALF A MONTH on Excel.

Plus - beta customers discovered avg Rp 2-4M/month in savings (food cost issues, theft, etc.).

So you're not spending Rp 4.7M. You're investing Rp 4.7M to save Rp 10M+ over the next year.

Still feel expensive?"
```

---

**Objection 3: "I tried Power BI before, didn't work"**

Response:
```
"You're not alone - 60% of people who buy generic Power BI templates fail to set it up.

The problem? CSV format confusion. POS exports are messy.

Here's what's different about ours:
1. Pre-built Excel templates (no CSV confusion)
2. Bahasa Indonesia tutorials (not English-only)
3. Setup support (see Product 02, not 'download and good luck')
4. F&B-specific (not generic business template)

[Customer Name] had the EXACT same experience. Bought a template 6 months before us, gave up.
Tried ours, working in 30 minutes.

Want me to send you a quick-start video so you can see the difference?"
```

---

### 3.3 Call Close - Next Steps

**If Interested (80% of qualified calls):**

```
"Great! Here's what happens next:

1. I'll send you a custom proposal (PDF) - shows pricing, what's included, ROI breakdown
2. You review (take 1-2 days, no rush)
3. If you have questions, we jump on a quick call
4. If you're ready, I send invoice
5. Once paid, you get access immediately (download portal)

I'll send that proposal by [tomorrow/end of day].

Any questions before we wrap up?"
```

**If Not Ready (20% of qualified calls):**

```
"No problem! Sounds like the timing isn't right yet.

Can I add you to my email list? I send weekly F&B data tips (no sales pitch, just useful stuff like
'How to calculate your TRUE food cost' or 'Benchmark labor cost for cafés').

When you're ready in a few months, you'll know who to call.

Sound fair?"
```

**Mark in CRM:**
- Hot lead (proposal sent)
- Warm lead (nurture sequence)
- Cold lead (long-term nurture)
