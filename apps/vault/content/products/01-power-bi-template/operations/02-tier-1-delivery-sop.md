## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Œ **Mistake 1: Delaying File Delivery**
- Customer paid, expects instant access
- >2 hour delay = increased support tickets ("Where are my files?")
- **Prevention:** Automate email + download link triggering off payment webhook

Œ **Mistake 2: Over-Engaging Non-Responsive Customers**
- Some customers buy but never use (buyer's remorse, changed plans)
- 3+ follow-up emails = spam feeling
- **Prevention:** Stick to 3-touchpoint cadence (Day 3 email, Day 7 WhatsApp, Day 25 reminder). If no response, move on.

Œ **Mistake 3: Giving Free Tier 2/3 Services**
- Customer: "Can you help me set it up real quick?"
- You (wanting to be helpful): Spend 2 hours on call
- **Prevention:** "I'd love to! That's what Tier 2 includes. Pay the difference (Rp 1-8.5M depending on your current tier and modules needed) and I'll schedule a 2-3 hour setup call."

Œ **Mistake 4: Not Tracking Customer Status**
- 30 days pass, you don't remember who got support when
- Customer emails after expiry expecting support
- **Prevention:** Use CRM/spreadsheet + calendar reminders religiously

Œ **Mistake 5: Not Offering Upgrades**
- Customer struggles, you don't mention Tier 2/3 exists
- Lost revenue opportunity
- **Prevention:** Every support interaction = gentle upsell mention ("By the way, if you want hands-on help, Tier 2 includes...")
