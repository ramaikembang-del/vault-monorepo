## Decision Tree (Friday Week 2)

### GATE 1A PASSES (5+ Sales, Rp 10M+ Revenue)

**Actions:**
1. **Proceed to Sprint 2** - Allocate Rp 10M Sprint 2 budget
2. **Scale marketing** - Increase ad spend Rp 1M -> Rp 3M/week
3. **Template Support launch** - Offer R1 subscription to buyers
4. **Celebrate** - Team debrief, document learnings

**Next Focus:**
- Gate 1C (R1 attachment rate 30%+)
- Gate 1B (E1 Lite 50+ users)

---

### [!] GATE 1A PARTIAL (3-4 Sales, Rp 10-12M Revenue)

**Analysis Required:**
- Demo funnel issue? (bookings low OR conversion low)
- Pricing too high? (lots of interest, no closes)
- Messaging unclear? (wrong audience attracted)

**Actions:**
1. **Extend 1 week** - Give Week 3 to hit 5 sales
2. **Tactical pivots:**
 - Lower Tier 1 price Rp 3.5M -> Rp 2.5M (launch promo for T1-Basic)
 - Offer payment plan (Rp 7M Tier 2 -> 3x Rp 2.5M)
 - Simplify demo (30 min -> 15 min)
3. **Intensify outreach:**
 - WhatsApp blast warm leads (50 contacts)
 - Facebook group posts (3 communities)

**Re-evaluate:** Friday Week 3 (final Gate 1A decision)

---

###  GATE 1A FAILS (0-2 Sales, <Rp 4M Revenue)

**Root Cause Analysis:**

| Possible Cause | Diagnostic | Fix |
|----------------|------------|-----|
| **Wrong market** | No demo bookings despite traffic | Pivot to Phase 3 (chains) instead of Phase 2 |
| **Price too high** | Many demos, no closes | Cut price 30% OR switch to freemium model |
| **Product unclear** | Demo attendees confused | Simplify pitch, focus on 1 use case |
| **Execution failure** | No traffic, no demos | Marketing strategy overhaul |

**Actions:**
1. **HOLD Sprint 2 budget** - Do NOT allocate Rp 10M
2. **Deep customer interviews** - Call all demo attendees, understand objections
3. **Pivot options:**
 - **Option A:** Relaunch with new pricing (Tier 1 free, Tier 2/3 paid)
 - **Option B:** Pivot to E1 Lite only (defer A1 template)
 - **Option C:** B2B2C via partnerships (sell to consultants who resell)

**Timeline:** 2-week analysis -> Relaunch Week 5
