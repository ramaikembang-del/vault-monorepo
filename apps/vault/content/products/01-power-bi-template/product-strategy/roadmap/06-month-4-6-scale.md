# Month 4-6 Execution Plan: Scale & Optimize

**Prerequisites:** Gate 2 PASSED (‰¥Rp 60M revenue, ‰¥50 customers, ‰¥5 T3 sales, NPS ‰¥50)

**Strategic Shift:** FROM building products TO scaling distribution and operations.

**Core Principle:** "The product is done. Now we sell."

**Revenue Target:** Month 4-6 cumulative Rp 150-200M (Month 1-6 total: Rp 210-270M)

---

## Strategic Framework: Scale Phase

### What Changes in Month 4-6

**STOP Doing:**
-  Building new product tiers or modules (T1/T2/T3 are complete)
-  Major feature development (no new metrics, no new tabs)
-  Custom development for individual customers (standardize, don't customize)
-  Manual, non-scalable processes (automate or delegate)

**START Doing:**
- Aggressive lead generation (2-3x current volume)
- Partnership channel development (POS vendors, accountants, consultants)
- Referral program (incentivize existing customers to refer)
- Content marketing at scale (weekly blog, YouTube, LinkedIn)
- Process documentation & automation (reduce time per customer)
- Team expansion (hire VA, contractors to handle growth)

**CONTINUE Doing:**
- Customer support (maintain <24h response)
- Product quality (fix bugs, but no new features)
- Sales demos (but streamline the process)

---

## Month 4: Sales & Marketing Scale-Up

**Monthly Goal:** Double lead volume, improve conversion, activate referrals.

 It auto-calculates 30-150 metrics (revenue, margins, staff performance, customer retention, etc.) from Excel/POS data.

 If you're interested, here's my referral link: [LINK]
 (You'll get 10% off, and I get a credit for referring you)

 Worth checking out if you're drowning in spreadsheets like I was.

### Week 16: Sales Process Optimization

**Goal:** Reduce time per demo, increase conversion rate, scale demos.

**Monday: Audit Current Sales Funnel**
- Analyze Month 1-3 data:
 - Lead sources: Where did 50+ customers come from? (LinkedIn X%, referrals Y%, organic Z%)
 - Conversion rates:
 - Cold lead -> Demo booked: [X]%
 - Demo booked -> Demo completed: [X]%
 - Demo completed -> Sale: [X]%
 - Avg time from demo -> sale: [X] days
 - Bottlenecks: Where are leads dropping off?

**Tuesday: Streamline Demo Process**

- **Target state:** 20 min standardized demos, self-booking, recorded demo option

**Improvements:**
1. **Self-Service Demo Video (15-20 min):**
 - Record comprehensive demo covering T1, T2, T3
 - Upload to YouTube (unlisted) or Loom
 - Send to prospects: "Watch this 15-min demo, then book a call if interested"
 - Filters out low-intent leads (if they won't watch 15 min, they won't buy)

2. **Calendly Integration:**
 - Set up Calendly with availability blocks (Mon-Fri 10am, 2pm, 4pm)
 - Auto-send calendar invite + pre-demo questionnaire
 - Pre-demo questionnaire (Google Form):
 - Business name & type (single outlet, multi-outlet)

 - Which tier interested in (T1, T2, T3)
 - Use questionnaire to customize demo (5 min prep vs 20 min custom research)

3. **Demo Script Standardization:**

 - Day 5: "Case study: How [Client X] got ROI in 30 days"
 - Day 7: "Limited-time offer: 10% off if you buy this week" (create urgency)
 - Day 10: "Last check-in: Still interested?"
 - Day 14: Move to nurture sequence (monthly tips, not sales)

**Thursday: Pricing Experiments (A/B Test)**
- **Hypothesis:** T1 pricing might be too low (Rp 3.5M), leaving money on table
- **Test:** For next 20 leads, split test:
 - Control: T1-Basic at Rp 3.5M
 - Variant: T1-Basic at Rp 4.5M
- **Measure:** Conversion rate, revenue per customer
- **Decision:** If Variant converts at >70% of Control rate, it's more profitable (higher price x 70% = more revenue than lower price x 100%)

**Friday: Sales Metrics Dashboard (Meta)**
- Create simple sales tracking sheet:
 - Columns: Date, Lead Source, Demo Date, Tier Interest, Proposal Sent, Sale Closed, Revenue, Days to Close
 - Weekly review: What's working? What's not?

 - Hire Customer Success Manager (PT, Rp 5-8M/month for T3 account management)
 2. **Product Adjacencies (NOT new product tiers, but complements):**
 - Offer "Done-For-You Setup" service (Rp 2-5M add-on, we import their data)
 - Offer "Monthly Data Refresh" service (Rp 500K-1M/month, we update their dashboard)
 - These are SERVICE add-ons, not product development
 3. **Market Expansion:**
 - Target new verticals (retail, healthcare) with same dashboard (minor customization)
 - Target new geographies (Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam) if Indonesian market saturated
 4. **Strategic Exit Prep (Optional):**
 - If profitable and growing, consider acquisition targets (POS vendors, F&B SaaS)
 - Document all processes for potential sale/acquisition

**If Month 1-6 hit Rp 150-210M -> Steady growth mode:**
- **Revenue Target Month 7-12:** Rp 250-350M (bring Year 1 total to Rp 400-560M)
- **Strategies:**
 1. Focus on retention & upsells (squeeze more LTV from existing customers)
 2. Improve conversion funnel (demo -> sale)
 3. Double down on best-performing channel (organic or referrals)
 4. Delay hiring until Month 9-10 (conserve cash)

**If Month 1-6 hit <Rp 150M -> Reassess:**
- Diagnose why growth stalled
- Fix product-market fit issues (customer interviews)
- Consider pivot or adjacent opportunities

## Next Phase Decision Point

**At end of Month 6, three paths:**

1. **SCALE (if Revenue ‰¥Rp 210M, Customers ‰¥100, LTV/CAC >3.0):**
 - Month 7-12: Aggressive growth (hire team, expand channels, Rp 400-600M target)

2. **OPTIMIZE (if Revenue Rp 150-210M, Customers 70-100, LTV/CAC 2-3):**
 - Month 7-12: Steady growth, improve unit economics, Rp 250-350M target

3. **PIVOT (if Revenue <Rp 150M, Customers <70, LTV/CAC <2):**
 - Month 7-9: Deep diagnosis, customer interviews, product/market adjustments
 - Month 10-12: Execute pivot or wind down

**The execution plan has brought you from $0 to Rp 210-270M in 6 months with 100-150 customers and 70-80% profit margin. The foundation is built. Now it's about scaling what works.**
