## How This Product Works: Two Dimensions

**Quick Customer View:**

### Dimension 1: Analytics Capabilities (What Insights You Get)
- **150 total metrics** organized into specialized modules
- Each tier includes a base metric set + optional add-on modules
- More modules = deeper analytics (not better service)

### Dimension 2: Service & Support (How You Get It)
- Dashboard pages, Excel templates, automation, training, support
- **These are FIXED per tier** - don't change when you add metric modules
- Choose your tier based on service level needed: **DIY**, **Assisted**, or **Fully Managed**

### Key Decision Framework

**Choose Your Tier by Service Need:**
- **Tier 1 (DIY):** You set everything up yourself with video guides (4-8h your time)
- **Tier 2 (Assisted):** We help you set up via 2-3h call, custom templates
- **Tier 3 (Managed):** We do everything, white-label, full automation, ongoing support

**Add Modules for Analytics Depth:**
- After choosing tier, add metric modules as needed
- Modules increase analytics capabilities, not service features
- Example: T2 + Multi-Outlet module = same assisted setup, but gain 12 outlet metrics

## Product Architecture: Two Integrated Dimensions (Detailed)

This F&B analytics product delivers value through **two complementary dimensions** that work together:

### Dimension 1: Analytics Capabilities (Metrics Modules)
**What You Get:** Business insights and metrics
- **150 total metrics** organized into 12 specialized modules
- **Base modules (30 metrics)** included in all tiers: Revenue Core, Menu Essentials, Staff & Customer Basics
- **Add-on modules** expand analytics depth within your tier
- **Tier-specific modules:**
 - Tier 1: T1-A/B/C add-ons (10 metrics each)
 - Tier 2: P1-4 Professional modules (11-15 metrics each)
 - Tier 3: S1-4 Strategic modules (11-15 metrics each)

### Dimension 2: Delivery & Service (Surrounding Features)
**How You Get It:** Implementation, automation, and support
- **Dashboard complexity:** Page count, drill-through, interactivity features
- **Excel customization:** Generic templates -> Custom pre-filled -> White-labeled
- **Automation level:** Manual refresh -> POS-specific -> Fully automated
- **Training depth:** Videos only -> Live calls -> Custom team training
- **Support:** Duration (30/90/unlimited days), speed (72h/48h/24h), channels (email/WhatsApp)
- **Setup assistance:** DIY -> Assisted -> Fully managed
- **Customization allowance:** Paid per change -> Limited free -> Unlimited monthly

**Critical Rule:** Surrounding features are **FIXED per tier**. They don't change when you add metric modules.

### How They Work Together

**When You Choose a Tier:**
1. You select based on the **service level** you need (DIY, Assisted, or Fully Managed)
2. You receive a **base metric set** for that tier (30, 50, or 100 metrics)
3. You get a **fixed package of surrounding features** for that tier

**When You Add Modules:**
1. You stay in your tier (same surrounding features)
2. You add **metric modules** to expand analytics capabilities
3. Price increases by module cost (+Rp 1-1.5M per module)

**When You Upgrade Tiers:**
1. You upgrade when you need **better surrounding features** (not just more metrics)
2. Example: Moving from DIY to Assisted setup, or Manual to Automated refresh
3. You get access to higher-tier metric modules

**Pricing Formula:**
```
Total Price = Tier Base + Optional Metric Modules

Tier 1: Rp 3.5M (30 metrics + DIY features) + [Rp 1M per T1 module] = Rp 3.5-6M
Tier 2: Rp 7M (50 metrics + Assisted features) + [Rp 1.25-1.5M per P module] = Rp 7-12M
Tier 3: Rp 10M (100 metrics + Managed features) + [Rp 1.25M per S module] = Rp 10-15M one-time
```

**Customer Journey Examples:**
- **Horizontal Expansion:** T2 Base (50 metrics) -> +P1 module (62 metrics) -> +P2 module (77 metrics) = Same assisted features, more analytics
- **Vertical Migration:** T1 (DIY) -> T2 (Assisted) -> T3 (Fully Managed) = Better features, more service depth

---

## Quick Decision Guide for Customers

### **Choose Your Tier by Service Need:**

**Ask yourself:** "How much help do I need setting this up?"

- **Tier 1 (DIY - Rp 3.5-6M):** You set everything up yourself with video guides
 - (Time) **Your time:** 4-8 hours
 - **Your effort:** Watch videos, configure templates, test yourself
 - **Best for:** Tech-comfortable owners, tight budget, want to learn the tool

- **Tier 2 (Assisted - Rp 7-12M):** We help you set up via 2-3 hour video call
 - (Time) **Your time:** 2-3 hours (mostly answering our questions)
 - **Our effort:** We configure, pre-fill YOUR data, optimize for YOUR POS
 - **Best for:** Growing business, value time over money, want customization

- **Tier 3 (Fully Managed - Rp 10-15M one-time):** We do everything, you just use it | Ongoing support optional (see Product 02)
 - (Time) **Your time:** 1 hour (handoff meeting only)
 - **Our effort:** Complete setup, ongoing maintenance, monthly strategy calls
 - **Best for:** Established chains, want white-label, need strategic partner

### **Then Add Modules for Analytics Depth:**

After choosing your tier (which determines HOW you get the product), add metric modules as needed (which determines WHAT insights you get).

**Example Decision Flow:**
```
Owner with 2 outlets, budget Rp 8-10M, doesn't want DIY hassle:
 †"
Choose Tier 2 (Assisted) = Rp 7M base
 †"
Add "Multi-Outlet Operations" module = +Rp 1.25M
 †"
Total: Rp 8.25M for 62 metrics + assisted setup + outlet analytics
```

**Key Point:** Modules increase analytics capabilities, NOT service features. All T2 customers get same assisted setup whether they have 50 or 100 metrics.

## Pricing Psychology

**Why Modular Pricing Works:**

1. **Modular = Choice**
 - Customers only pay for metrics they'll actually use
 - No "wasted" metrics they don't understand

2. **Clear Value Ladder**
 - Each module adds ~Rp 1.25M
 - Easy math: "I need this module, it costs +Rp 1.25M"

3. **Prevents Feature Creep**
 - Can't ask for "just one more metric" at same price
 - Want more? Buy the module.

4. **Upsell Path**
 - Start with base -> add modules over time
 - "Your business is growing, add Multi-Outlet module for Rp 1.25M"

---

## Sales Scripts for Modular Pricing

### **Tier 2 Scenario:**

**Prospect:** "I have 2 outlets, what do I need?"

**You:** "Start with our Base package at Rp 7M - that's 50 core metrics plus assisted setup. Then add the Multi-Outlet Operations module for Rp 1.25M. Total: Rp 8.25M. This gives you 62 metrics including outlet comparison, which is exactly what you need."

---

### **Tier 3 Scenario:**

**Prospect:** "I'm raising Series A, need executive dashboard for investors."

**You:** "Perfect. Start with our Enterprise Base at Rp 10M - that's 100 metrics fully managed. Then add the Executive Intelligence module for Rp 1.25M. Total: Rp 11.25M one-time. This includes board-ready summaries, forecasting, and scenario analysis - exactly what investors want to see."

## Module Popularity Forecast (Year 1)

### **Tier 2:**

| Module | Attach Rate | Avg Price Impact |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Multi-Outlet Operations | 60% | +Rp 1.25M |
| Menu Optimization | 40% | +Rp 1.25M |
| Workforce Analytics | 30% | +Rp 1.5M |
| Customer Mastery | 25% | +Rp 1.5M |

**Expected Tier 2 Average Price:** Rp 9.2M (base Rp 7M + 1.8 modules avg)

---

### **Tier 3:**

| Module | Attach Rate | Avg Price Impact |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Executive Intelligence | 80% | +Rp 1.25M |
| Advanced Workforce | 50% | +Rp 1.25M |
| Advanced Menu | 40% | +Rp 1.25M |
| Customer Intelligence | 30% | +Rp 1.25M |

**Expected Tier 3 Average Price:** Rp 12.5M (base Rp 10M + 2 modules avg)

---

## Implementation Notes for Modules

**For Development:**
- Build base metrics first (30, then 50)
- Build modules independently (can ship incrementally)
- Each module = separate DAX measure group

**For Sales:**
- Lead with base price (Rp 7M or Rp 10M)
- Qualify which modules they need
- Bundle discount: All 4 modules = Rp 5M (vs Rp 5.5M a la carte)

**For Customer Success:**
- Month 3: "You've been using base. Would Multi-Outlet help?"
- Month 6: "Seeing menu issues? Add Menu Optimization module"
- Upsell = add modules, not upgrade tiers
