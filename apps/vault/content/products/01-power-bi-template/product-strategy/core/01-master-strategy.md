## 2. Tiering Overview

### **Tiering Philosophy**

**ALL tiers get the same ecosystem components.**

**What tiers on:**
1. **Service Level** (DIY vs Assisted vs Managed)
2. **Metrics Depth** (30-50 vs 50-100 vs 100-150)
3. **Features** (Basic vs Enhanced vs Advanced)
4. **Customization** (Generic vs Custom vs White-label)

### **The Three Tiers**

| Tier | Service | Metrics | Price | Target |
|------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| **T1: Essentials** | DIY | 30-50 | Rp 3.5-6M | 1 outlet, self-serve |
| **T2: Professional** | Assisted | 50-100 | Rp 7-12M | 2-3 outlets, time-constrained |
| **T3: Enterprise** | Managed | 100-150 | Rp 10-15M | 3-5+ outlets, strategic partner |

## 7. Sales Playbook

### **Lead Qualification**

**Questions to ask:**
1. How many outlets? (1 = T1, 2-3 = T2, 3-5+ = T3)
2. Current data tool? (Excel = T1, Nothing = need help = T2, Analyst = T3)
3. Technical comfort? (High = T1, Medium = T2, Low = T3)
4. Budget? (<5M = T1, 5-10M = T2, 10M+ = T3)

---

### **Tier 1 Sales Script**

**When to recommend:**
- 1 outlet
- Comfortable with Excel
- Has 4-8 hours for setup
- Budget Rp 3.5-6M

**Script:**
> "Start with our Essentials package. Rp 3.5M gets you 30 core metrics - everything you need to track revenue, menu, staff, and customers. You'll set it up yourself (we provide videos), but you own it forever. If you want more depth, upgrade to 40 or 50 metrics for Rp 4.5-6M."

**Upsell:**
- Struggling with setup -> Upgrade to T2 (pay difference + Rp 1M)
- Need more metrics -> Add +10 or +20 metrics (Rp 1-2.5M more)

---

### **Tier 2 Sales Script**

**When to recommend:**
- 2-3 outlets
- Busy, no time for DIY
- Want it done RIGHT first time
- Budget Rp 7-12M

**Script:**
> "Our Professional package is perfect for you. Rp 7M base gets you 50 metrics plus we set it up together in 2-3 hours. Your data is pre-filled, so it's ready to use immediately. Then choose the modules you need:
>
> - Running 2-3 outlets? Add Multi-Outlet module (+Rp 1.25M)
> - Want menu optimization? Add Menu module (+Rp 1.25M)
> - Full package with all modules? Rp 12M total."

**Example:**
> "For 2 outlets, I recommend: Base (Rp 7M) + Multi-Outlet module (Rp 1.25M) = **Rp 8.25M**. You get 62 metrics including outlet comparison."

---

### **Tier 3 Sales Script**

**When to recommend:**
- 3-5+ outlets
- Need ongoing support
- Want strategic partner
- Raising investment / scaling

**Script:**
> "Our Enterprise package is a strategic partnership. Rp 10M setup includes 100 metrics fully managed - we handle everything. Plus optional support (see Product 02) for ongoing maintenance and strategy calls.
>
> Need investor-ready dashboards? Add Executive Intelligence module (+Rp 1.25M).

---

### **Handling Objections**

**"Too expensive"**
- Compare to time cost (3h/week x Rp 100K/h = Rp 15.6M/year wasted)
- Compare to consultant (Rp 15-25M)
- Offer T1 "Start lean at Rp 3.5M"

**"I already use Excel"**
- "Great! We're not replacing Excel. Power BI reads your Excel and creates dashboards. Staff keep using Excel."

**"Don't I need Power BI Pro license?"**
- "No. Desktop version is free forever. You only need Pro if you want cloud publishing (optional)."

**"What if I outgrow the tier?"**
- "Easy. You can upgrade anytime by paying the difference. Most T1 customers move to T2 within 6 months as they grow."

---

### **Modular Upsell Strategy**

**Month 3 check-in:**
> "How's it going? I noticed you're using the base package. Would Multi-Outlet Operations help now that you're opening a second location? Just +Rp 1.25M."

**Month 6 review:**
> "You've been great with the dashboard. Seeing any menu challenges? Our Menu Optimization module (+Rp 1.25M) could help identify which items to promote or remove."

**Month 12 renewal (T3 only):**
> "Let's review your metrics. You're using 100 now. Would Executive Intelligence help with your Series A pitch? Just +Rp 1.25M to add forecasting and board-ready dashboards."

## 9. Retention Strategy - Gamification

### **Core Philosophy**

**Strategic Insight:** Don't just track business metrics. Track the OWNER'S growth journey.

**Goal:** Transform checking the dashboard from "boring chore" to "exciting game."

When owners check dashboard for **fun** (not just need) = product stickiness.

### **Why Gamification Works for F&B Owners**

**Problem to Solve:**
- Dashboard usage drops after initial excitement (Week 1: daily, Week 4: once/week, Month 3: abandoned)
- Owners don't know if they're "doing well" (metrics are confusing)
- No clear path to mastery (what should I improve first?)

**Gamification Solution:**

1. **Habit Formation:** Streaks = daily engagement
 - Psychology: Loss aversion (don't want to break streak)
 - Implementation: "Daily Driver" achievement, streak counter

2. **Goal Clarity:** Achievements = guided learning
 - Psychology: Clear milestones = motivation
 - Implementation: 52 badges that teach best practices

3. **Progress Visibility:** Levels = sense of mastery
 - Psychology: RPG-style progression feels rewarding
 - Implementation: 10 levels from "Beginner" to "Business Master"

4. **Social Proof:** Leaderboard = competitive motivation (Tier 3)
 - Psychology: Comparison + community
 - Implementation: Anonymous ranking, "Top 10%" badges

5. **Celebration:** Badges = pride & sharing
 - Psychology: Achievement unlocked = dopamine hit
 - Implementation: Shareable certificates, social media templates

### **The North Star Metric: Business Health Score**

**Concept:** Single 0-100 score visible on every page showing holistic business health.

**Why It Works:**
- Single number = easy to track progress
- Shows HOLISTIC health (not just revenue)
- Includes behavior (data maturity) = rewards good habits
- Feels like leveling up (gamification)

**Components (Weighted):**
- 30% Financial Health (revenue, costs, profit)
- 30% Operational Excellence (staff, inventory, coverage)
- 20% Customer Success (repeat rate, transaction value)
- 20% Data Maturity (usage streak, insights discovered, actions taken)

**Strategic Value:**
- Encourages daily usage (data maturity component)
- Teaches best practices (achievement guidance)
- Provides simple talking point ("My score is 78!")
- Differentiates from competitor templates

### **Retention Mechanics**

**Five Proven Patterns:**

1. **Daily Streak (Like Duolingo)**
 - Mechanic: Track consecutive days of dashboard usage
 - Hook: Don't break the streak!
 - Implementation: Email/WhatsApp nudges at 6pm if not checked

2. **Level System (Like RPG Games)**
 - Mechanic: Earn points -> Level up -> Unlock features
 - Hook: Progress towards mastery
 - Implementation: 10 levels, visible on every page

## 10. Design Excellence Strategy

### **Core Philosophy**

**Strategic Insight:** Marketing gets them in. Product makes them stay.

**The Standard:** If a customer opens the template and says "WOW" in the first 10 seconds, we've succeeded.

### **Why Design Excellence Matters**

**Problem to Solve:**
- Default Power BI templates look corporate, boring, and intimidating
- Customers buy templates then abandon them (poor first impression)
- Low perceived value = no referrals, high churn

**Design Excellence Solution:**

Our product must be **10x better than default Power BI** in three dimensions:

1. **More Beautiful** (Visual Design)
 - Psychology: Beautiful = professional = trustworthy
 - Implementation: Indonesian F&B-specific color palette, cultural familiarity

2. **More Intuitive** (UX Design)
 - Psychology: Easy to use = return frequently
 - Implementation: 3-click rule, visual slicers, contextual tooltips

3. **More Delightful** (Aha Moments)
 - Psychology: Delight = sharing = referrals
 - Implementation: Celebration moments, auto-insights, gamification

### **The "Aha Moment" Engineering Approach**

**Concept:** Engineer specific moments of delight into the product.

**Goal:** User sees value in first 10 minutes (before frustration sets in).

**Critical Design Decision: Demo Data Pre-loaded**

Why this matters strategically:
- User sees beautiful dashboard IMMEDIATELY upon opening
- No frustration with "empty charts" (common failure point)
- Understands value BEFORE doing work
- Reduces time-to-wow from 30 minutes to 10 seconds

**Psychology:** Instant gratification. Show the end result first, then teach how to get their own data in.

### **Progressive Disclosure Strategy**

**Philosophy:** Gradually reveal power, don't dump everything Day 1.

**Implementation Approach:**

**Week 1 Experience:**
- Show only Executive Summary tab
- Hide advanced features (drill-through, what-if parameters)
- After 3 refreshes -> Show tip: "Unlock more features?"

**Week 2 Experience:**
- Unlock Revenue Deep Dive tab
- Show contextual insights: "Top 5 products hari ini: [list]"

**Week 3+ Experience:**
- Unlock all tabs and advanced features
- Show tip: "Sekarang kamu pro! Join WhatsApp community?"

**Why This Works:**
- Prevents overwhelm (common reason for abandonment)
- Creates sense of progress and mastery
- Encourages habit formation before revealing complexity

### **Design as Competitive Differentiation**

**Market Position:** We're NOT competing on features alone. We're competing on EXPERIENCE.

**Comparison - Why We're Not "Just Another Template":**

| Dimension | Default Power BI | Marketplace Templates | **Our Template** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Visual Design** | Corporate boring | Generic colorful | Indonesian F&B specific |
| **Language** | English | English | Bahasa Indonesia |
| **Sample Data** | None | Generic retail | Real F&B cafe data |
| **Onboarding** | None | PDF manual | Video + Interactive walkthrough |
| **Support** | Community forums | None | 30-day WhatsApp support |
| **Tooltips** | Default numbers | Basic | Contextual insights + actions |
| **Mobile** | Not optimized | Not optimized | Responsive layout |

**Strategic Value:** These design choices create 10x perceived value vs competitors at same price point.

### **Success Metrics - How We Know Product Is "Sexy"**

**Quantitative Targets:**
- Time to first insight: < 10 minutes (setup + import + see value)
- Daily active usage: > 5 times/week (becomes habit)
- Feature discovery: 80% users find drill-through in Week 1
- Support tickets: < 5% of users need help with basics

**Qualitative Indicators:**
- NPS > 70 (customers recommend)
- Unsolicited testimonials: "Wah, dashboard ini keren!"
- Screenshot shares: Customers proudly share on social media
- Referrals: 30%+ of customers refer friends organically

**The Ultimate Test:**
Ask user: "Would you pay 2x the price for this?"
If > 50% say yes -> Product is sexy enough.
