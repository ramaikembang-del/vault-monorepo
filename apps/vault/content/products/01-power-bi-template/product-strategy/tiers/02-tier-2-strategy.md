## Product Positioning

### **Core Value Proposition**

"You get a world-class dashboard without the DIY hassle. We set it up together on a live call, optimize it for your specific POS system, and you're live in under 3 hours."

**Key Differentiators vs Tier 1:**
- **Live setup assistance** (2-3 hour screen-sharing call)
- **POS-specific optimization** (we configure for your exact CSV format)
- **Extended support** (90 days vs 30 days)
- **1 free customization** included (add/modify metric)
- **1 free template update** (when v2.0 releases)

**Key Differentiators vs Tier 3:**
- **One-time setup** (not ongoing managed service)
- **Lower cost** (Rp 7-12M vs Rp 10-15M one-time)
- **You own the process** after handoff (refresh data yourself)

---

## Target Customer Profile

### **Primary Persona: "The Scaling Operator"**

**Demographics:**
- 1-3 outlets (expanding from 1 -> 2 or stable at 2-3)
- 15-40 staff
- Rp 500M - 2B annual revenue
- Uses modern POS (Pawoon, Moka, Qasir)

**Psychographics:**
- Tech-comfortable but not expert (can use smartphone apps confidently)
- Time-constrained (managing operations, can't spend 4 hours on setup)
- Quality-conscious (willing to pay for professional help)
- Risk-averse (wants guarantee it'll work before investing time)

**Pain Points (English Summary):**
- "I tried Power BI before but got stuck connecting data"
- "I don't have 4 hours to figure this out myself"

**Pain Points (Realitas Lapangan - Indonesian Detail):**
1. **"Pusing consolidate 3 file Excel"** -> Tiap outlet kirim report sendiri. Owner abis waktu copy-paste jadi satu master file.
2. **"Format data beda-beda"** -> Manager Outlet A pake format X, Manager Outlet B pake format Y. Power BI standardizes this.
3. **"Butuh compare apple-to-apple"** -> Susah bandingkan performa outlet kalau datanya terpisah.
4. **"Takut salah rumus konsolidasi"** -> Manual merging sering error. Dashboard otomatis gabungin data 3 outlet.

**"Excel + Power BI" Symbiosis (Consolidation Engine):**
- **Excel = Distributed Input:** Tiap outlet tetap input/export Excel masing-masing (no new system needed).
- **Power BI = Central Hub:** Cukup taruh 3 file Excel di satu folder. Dashboard otomatis baca & gabungin (Consolidated View).
- **Benefit:** Manager outlet happy (tetap pakai Excel), Owner happy (dapat Consolidated Dashboard).

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- "Consolidate reports from multiple locations without manual copy-pasting"
- "Standardize reporting format across all outlets"
- "Compare performance of Outlet A vs Outlet B instantly"
- "Get a single 'God View' of the entire business empire"

### **Secondary Persona: "The Reluctant Upgrader"**

**Who:** Tier 1 customers who struggled with setup

**Conversion Trigger:**
- Bought Tier 1, attempted setup, gave up after 2-3 hours
- Emailed support: "Can you just help me set this up?"
- Willing to pay upgrade difference (Rp 3-4M)

**Messaging:**
"Upgrade to Tier 2 - pay the difference and I'll set it up with you this week."

## Revenue Model

### **Revenue Targets (Per Quarter)**

**Conservative (Q1):**
- 5 Tier 2 sales × Rp 9M (avg) = Rp 45M
- 40% are upgrades from Tier 1 (2 customers × Rp 4.5M difference) = Rp 9M
- 60% are direct Tier 2 purchases (3 customers × Rp 9M) = Rp 27M
- **Total:** Rp 36M/quarter

**Optimistic (Q2-Q4):**
- 10 Tier 2 sales × Rp 9M (avg) = Rp 90M
- **Total:** ~Rp 300M/year (if maintained)

### **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**

**Initial Purchase:** Rp 9M (avg)

**Expansion Revenue (Next 12 Months):**
- Module add-ons: 40% add 1-2 modules × Rp 1.25M avg = Rp 500K
- 2nd+ customization: 30% request × Rp 750K avg = Rp 225K
- Upgrade to Tier 3: 15% convert × (Rp 3.5M setup difference + Rp 4.8M year 1 monthly) = Rp 1.25M
- Referral commission: 10% refer × Rp 900K fee = Rp 90K
- **Avg expansion:** Rp 2.06M/customer

**Total LTV:** Rp 9M + Rp 2.06M = **Rp 11.06M**

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### **Customer Acquisition Channels**

**1. Tier 1 Upgrade Funnel (40% of sales)**

**Trigger:** Tier 1 customer sends support email expressing frustration

**Playbook:**
```
Support Response Template:
"Hi [Name], I can see you're stuck on [issue].

Quick solution: Upgrade to Tier 2 for Rp 3-4M and I'll help you set this up
on a live call this week. Usually takes 2-3 hours and you're fully live.

Book here: [Calendly link]

Or I can send you the troubleshooting steps if you want to keep trying solo.

- Customer exports sample POS data (85% success rate)
- Customer attends scheduled setup call (90% attendance)

**During-Call Success:**

### **Support Strategy (90 Days)**

**Week 1-4:** High-touch
- Check-in email Day 3 ("Working okay?")
- WhatsApp follow-up Day 7 if no response
- Proactive: "Saw you haven't logged in-everything ok?"

**Week 5-12:** Reactive
- Respond to support emails <48h
- Offer 1 free customization (remind them it's included)
- Track usage (if low, offer check-in call)

**Day 85 (Support Expiry Warning):**
- Email: "Support expires in 5 days"
- Offer upgrade to Tier 3: "Want ongoing support? optional support (see Product 02) gets you unlimited + monthly calls"
- **Goal:** 15% convert to Tier 3

---

## Expansion Revenue Opportunities

### **1. Customization Requests (Post-Freebie)**

**Pricing:** Rp 500K - 1M per customization

**Common Requests:**
- Add new metric (food waste %, table turnover)
- Change chart type (bar -> line graph)
- Add new data source (inventory system integration)

**Upsell:** "Need 2+ customizations? Upgrade to Tier 3 - includes 2/month for optional support (see Product 02) (cheaper than 1-off fees)"

---

### **2. Upgrade to Tier 3**

**Trigger Scenarios:**
- Customer requests 2nd+ customization -> "Save money with Tier 3"
- Customer says "data refresh is annoying" -> "We'll automate it on Tier 3"
- Customer asks for strategic advice -> "Tier 3 includes monthly consulting calls"

**Close Rate:** 15% of Tier 2 customers upgrade within 6 months

**Revenue:** Rp 4M setup fee + Rp 4.8M/year = Rp 8.8M additional LTV

---

### **3. Referral Program**

**Offer:** Refer a friend -> They get 10% off -> You get Rp 500K credit (toward Tier 3 upgrade or extra customizations)

**Promotion:** Email at Day 30 ("Your dashboard's working great - know anyone else who needs this?")

**Conversion:** 10-15% refer at least 1 customer

---

## Risk Mitigation

### **Risk 1: Setup Call Runs Over 3 Hours**

**Cause:** Customer's data is messier than expected (duplicates, format issues)

**Mitigation:**
- Set expectation: "If data cleanup takes >30 min, we pause and you clean it, then reschedule"
- Pre-call checklist: Ask customer to send sample data 24h before call (we validate in advance)
- Fallback: Offer to do data cleanup offline (charge Rp 500K extra or include if "Premium" tier)

---

### **Risk 2: Customer Doesn't Attend Setup Call**

**Cause:** Busy schedule, forgot, de-prioritized

**Mitigation:**
- Calendar reminder: Send 24h before + 1h before
- WhatsApp reminder: Personal message day-of
- Reschedule policy: 1 free reschedule, 2nd reschedule = Rp 500K fee (encourages commitment)

---

### **Risk 3: Low Tier 1 -> Tier 2 Upgrade Rate**

**Cause:** Tier 1 customers successfully DIY, don't need help

**Mitigation:**
- Make Tier 1 setup harder (remove some documentation) UNETHICAL, SKIP
- Better approach: Identify "struggle signals" early (support email, no login for 7 days) -> Proactive upgrade offer
- Discount: Offer upgrade for Rp 3.5M (vs Rp 4.5M) if they upgrade within 14 days of Tier 1 purchase
