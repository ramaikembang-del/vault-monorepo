## Target Customer Profile & Personas

### **Primary Persona: "The Budget-Conscious Learner"**

**Demographics:**
- 1 outlet (single location)
- 5-15 staff
- Rp 200M - 800M annual revenue (~Rp 17-67M/month)
- Uses basic POS (Pawoon, Moka, or even Excel-based tracking)
- Age: 28-40
- Education: High school to bachelor's degree

**Psychographics:**
- **Budget-sensitive:** Rp 3.5-6M feels like a significant investment, Rp 10M+ is out of reach
- **Tech-comfortable:** Uses smartphone apps confidently, can follow YouTube tutorials
- **DIY mindset:** "I can figure this out myself if there's a good guide"
- **Learning-oriented:** Willing to invest 4-8 hours to save Rp 5-8M on consulting
- **Control-focused:** "I want to own this tool, not depend on someone monthly"
- **Proof-seeking:** Wants to validate analytics value before bigger investment
- **Module-conscious:** Prefers to start with essential metrics, add more later

**Pain Points (Realitas Lapangan):**
1. **"Excel gue berantakan, butuh visual"** -> Data ada di Excel, tapi susah dibaca. Butuh "kacamata" (dashboard).
2. **"Modal tipis, margin tipis"** -> Kalo harus ganti system (move away from Excel), itu mahal & ribet.
3. **"Takut salah input"** -> Excel rawan error rumus. Power BI baca data raw, rumus di-lock di dashboard.
4. **"Gue nggak mau ganti cara kerja"** -> Staff udah biasa input Excel. Jangan ubah workflow, ubah output-nya.

**"Excel + Power BI" Symbiosis (The Angle):**
- **Excel = Input Engine:** Staff input sales/expense di Excel (gratis, familiar, offline).
- **Power BI = Visualization Engine:** Dashboard baca file Excel itu lalu tampilkan grafik ciamik (profesional, otomatis).
- **Benefit:** 0% learning curve buat staff (tetap pakai Excel), 100% upgrade output buat Owner.

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- "Keep using Excel for input (familiarity) but get Professional Dashboard for insights"
- "Visualize messy Excel data without learning complex formulas"
- "Prove analytics value without changing operational workflow"



**Success Indicators:**
- Successfully connects POS data within 4 hours
- Uses dashboard 2-3x/week minimum
- Discovers 1+ actionable insight in Week 1
- Refers to dashboard when making menu/pricing decisions
- Feels confident explaining metrics to staff/partners

**Example:** Dimas (Warung Kopi Owner)
- 1 cafe, 8 staff, Rp 35M/month revenue
- Uses Moka POS, exports to Excel currently
- Tried Google Data Studio but "too generic, not F&B-specific"
- Budget: Max Rp 6M for analytics, prefers Rp 3.5-4.5M
- Quote: "I know I need better data, but I can't afford a consultant. If I can learn Power BI myself, that's a skill I keep forever."

---

### **Secondary Persona: "The Tech-Savvy Operator"**

**Demographics:**
- 1-2 outlets
- 10-25 staff
- Rp 500M - 1.5B annual revenue (~Rp 42-125M/month)
- Modern tech stack (cloud POS, digital payments, active on social media)
- Age: 30-42
- Often has business/tech background

**Psychographics:**
- **Tech-forward:** Early adopter, comfortable with software
- **Value-conscious:** Willing to pay, but wants best price/value ratio
- **Hands-on:** Prefers to understand how things work under the hood
- **Efficiency-driven:** Sees time investment as skill-building, not waste
- **Growth-oriented:** Building business for scale, not just survival

**Pain Points:**
- "I know I need analytics, but Tier 2/3 feels like overkill for my current size"
- "I want to learn Power BI anyway for my career - might as well start here"
- "I can handle setup myself, why pay 3x more for hand-holding?"
- "I need to prove analytics ROI to myself before committing to monthly fees"

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- Build analytics capability in-house (not outsource)
- Upskill in data analysis (personal development)
- Test analytics value before scaling investment
- Maintain lean operations (minimize fixed costs)
- Prepare for growth (learn tools that scale)

**Upgrade Path:**
- Uses Tier 1 successfully for 3-6 months
- Opens 2nd-3rd outlet -> Needs multi-location view -> Upgrades to Tier 2/3
- Or: Gets too busy to maintain -> Upgrades to Tier 3 for managed service
- Or: Validates value -> Transitions to Full SaaS when ready

**Example:** Rina (Modern Cafe Chain Starter)
- 2 cafes (opened 2nd location 3 months ago)
- 18 staff total, Rp 90M/month revenue
- Uses Pawoon POS, already exports data regularly
- Tech-savvy: Built own website, manages Instagram ads
- Quote: "I'm opening outlet #3 next year. I need to learn analytics now while I'm small, so I'm ready when I scale."

---

### **Tertiary Persona: "The Validation Seeker"**

**Who:** Operators who want to "try before they buy" on Tier 2/3

**Trigger:**
- Interested in Tier 2/3 but skeptical about value
- Wants to validate analytics impact first
- "Let me try Tier 1 for Rp 3.5-6M. If it works, I'll upgrade to managed service"

**Characteristics:**
- Risk-averse (wants proof before bigger commitment)
- Budget-flexible (can afford Tier 2/3, but wants validation)
- Analytical (makes decisions based on data/evidence)

**Messaging:**
"Start with Tier 1 (Rp 3.5-6M depending on modules). If you love it and want help, upgrade to Tier 2 (pay difference to Rp 7-12M). If you outgrow DIY, move to Tier 3. No risk."

**Conversion Rate:** 30-40% upgrade to Tier 2/3 within 6 months

**Example:** Amanda (Considering Tier 2)
- 3 bubble tea cafes, Rp 150M/month revenue
- Can afford Tier 2 (Rp 7-12M) but wants to test first
- Buys Tier 1, uses for 2 months, loves it
- Upgrades to Tier 2 when opening 4th outlet
- Quote: "I wanted to make sure this actually helps before spending Rp 7-12M. After 2 months with Tier 1, I'm convinced. Now I just want someone to manage it for me."
