## Target Customer Profile

### **Primary Persona: "The Delegating Entrepreneur"**

**Demographics:**
- 2-5 outlets (multi-location operator)
- 40-100 staff
- Rp 2B - 8B annual revenue
- Modern tech stack (cloud POS, accounting software, maybe ERP)

**Psychographics:**
- **Time is most valuable asset** (Rp 500K/month feels cheap vs 5 hours/month of their time)
- **Delegation mindset** ("I pay experts to handle things I don't want to learn")
- **Strategic thinker** (uses data to make decisions, not gut feel)
- **Quality-obsessed** (willing to pay premium for reliability)
- **Long-term oriented** (building a business for 10+ years)

**Pain Points (Realitas Lapangan):**
1. **"GM minta report tiap Senin"** -> Sekarang manual Excel 4 jam/minggu. Telat dikit kena omel.
2. **"Data nggak real-time"** -> Meeting bahas data bulan lalu (basi). Butuh data kemarin.
3. **"Staff spent time bikin report"** -> Bukan analisa, cuma copy-paste data. Waste of talent.
4. **"Investor butuh professional view"** -> Excel keliatan amatiran. Dashboard = credibility.

**"Excel + Power BI" Symbiosis (Executive Engine):**
- **Excel = Ad-hoc Analysis:** Kalau butuh deep dive specific, export data dari dashboard ke Excel.
- **Power BI = Automated Reporting:** Laporan rutin (daily/weekly) 100% otomatis. Zero effort.
- **Benefit:** GM happy (report rapi on-time), Manager happy (nggak lembur bikin report).

**Jobs to Be Done:**
- "Automate weekly executive reporting (replace manual Excel hell)"
- "Present professional data to stakeholders (investors/GM)"
- "Detect anomalies across multiple outlets instantly"
- "Audit performance objectively (no 'data manipulation' possible)"

---

### **Tertiary Persona: "The Franchise/Enterprise Player"**

**Who:** 5-15+ outlets, serious scale ambitions

**Trigger:** Needs white-label, multi-location, advanced features

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### **Customer Acquisition Channels**

**1. Tier 2 Upsell (50% of sales)**

**Trigger Events:**
- Customer uses dashboard daily for 30+ days (power user signal)
- Customer requests 2nd+ customization
- Customer complains about manual data refresh
- Customer expands to 3rd outlet

**Playbook:**
```
Email Template (Day 85 of Tier 2):
"Hi [Name], your 90-day support expires next week.

I've noticed you're a power user (15+ logins/month!) and requested 2
customizations. Clearly, this dashboard is valuable to you.

Want to upgrade to Tier 3? Benefits:
 Unlimited support forever (vs support ending)
 Automated data refresh (vs manual every day)
 Monthly consulting calls (interpret trends together)
 2 free customizations/month (vs Rp 1M each)

Pay difference (Rp 3.5M avg) (support optional - see Product 02). ROI: If dashboard saves you
2 hours/month, that's Rp 1M/month in your time (pays for itself 2.5x).

Book a call to discuss?"
```

**Conversion rate:** 15-20% of Tier 2 customers

---

**2. Direct Enterprise Sales (30% of sales)**

**Target:** 3-5 outlet operators, revenue Rp 5B+

**Messaging:**
- "You're at scale now. Tier 1/2 are for startups. Tier 3 is for businesses like yours."
- "Your time is worth Rp 1M/hour. We save you 5 hours/month = Rp 5M/month value for the one-time price."

**Channels:**
- LinkedIn outreach (founder connects with peers)
- Warm referrals (existing Tier 3 customers introduce us)
- Industry events (F&B conferences, networking)

---

**3. Referrals (20% of sales)**

**Referral Incentive:**
- Refer a customer -> They get 1 month free (Rp 400K value)
- You get Rp 1M credit (toward setup fee if starting, or 2.5 months free if existing)

**Promotion:** Quarterly email to all Tier 3 customers asking for referrals

---

## Sales Process

### **Sales Cycle: 14-21 Days** (Longer than Tier 1/2 due to higher price)

**Week 1: Discovery**
- Lead inquiry -> Book discovery call (30-45 min)
- Discovery call:
 - Current analytics setup? (Excel? No analytics?)
 - Pain points? (Time waste? Bad decisions from lack of data?)
 - Budget? (Is Rp 10-15M setup (support optional - see Product 02) feasible?)
 - Decision process? (Need board approval? Wife approval? Solo decision?)
- Send case study + testimonial from similar business

**Week 2: Proposal**
- Custom proposal (PDF):
 - Their specific pain points addressed
 - ROI calculation (time saved, better decisions = revenue impact)
 - Pricing (Standard vs Premium options)
 - Timeline (go-live in 5 days)
 - Guarantee (30-day money-back if not satisfied)
- Follow-up call (handle objections)

**Week 3: Close**
- Decision made -> Send invoice
- Payment received -> Kickoff call scheduled
- Or: Need more time -> Follow-up Week 4

**Success Rate:** 40-50% of discovery calls -> closed deals (higher than Tier 1/2 due to better qualification)

---

## Expansion Revenue Opportunities

**1. Extra Customizations (Beyond 2/Month)**
- Pricing: Rp 500K each
- Offer: "Want 5 customizations this month? Upgrade to Premium tier (3/month included)"

**Annual Expansion Revenue:** +Rp 1-2M/customer avg

**Net Revenue Retention:** 110-120% (customers paying more year-over-year despite 10% churn)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### **Risk 1: High Churn (>20% Annual)**

**Causes:**
- Customer doesn't see ROI (dashboard not used)
- Financial distress (can't afford optional support (see Product 02))
- Competitor offers cheaper alternative

**Mitigation:**
- Quarterly business reviews (prove ROI with data)
- Flexible pricing: Offer 6-month payment plan if cash flow tight
- Lock-in: Annual contract with 10% discount (Rp 4.8M -> Rp 4.3M)

---

### **Risk 2: Negative Profit Margin (Service costs > optional support (see Product 02))**

**Causes:**
- Customer requires >8 hours service/month
- High customization requests (5+/month)
- Excessive support tickets (complex issues)

**Mitigation:**
- Set expectations clearly in SLA (2 customizations included, more = extra fee)
- Track hours per customer (if >10 hours/month, raise price next renewal or fire customer)
- Automate where possible (reduce manual work)

---

### **Risk 3: Low Tier 2->Tier 3 Upgrade Rate (<10%)**

**Causes:**
- Tier 2 customers satisfied with current setup (no pain driving upgrade)
- Price jump feels steep (Rp 9M -> Rp 8.3M additional for Year 1, but recurring)
- Don't see value in monthly calls

**Mitigation:**
- Make Tier 2 support expiry painful (email: "Support ends tomorrow, issues will go unanswered")
- Highlight time savings ROI (not features): "Save 5 hours/month = Rp 10M value"
- Offer trial: "Try Tier 3 for 1 month free, see if you like it"

### **Pricing Validation**

**Price Sensitivity Analysis:**

| Price Point | Willingness to Buy | Margin | Revenue (10 customers Year 1) |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Rp 10M base | 80% | Medium | Rp 80M (8 customers) |
| **Rp 12.5M avg** | **80%** | **High** | **Rp 125M (10 customers)** |
| Rp 15M base | 60% | Very High | Rp 90M (6 customers) |
| Rp 20M+ | 30% | Extreme | Rp 60M (3 customers) |

**Optimal Price:** Rp 12.5M avg (support optional - see Product 02) (maximizes revenue, maintains 80% conversion)

**Price Anchoring Validated:**
- vs In-House Analyst (Rp 120M/year): 9/10 said "Tier 3 is way better value"
- vs Tier 2 + time waste (Rp 9M + 5h/month): 8/10 said "Tier 3 saves me so much time"
- vs BI Agency (Rp 30M+ Year 1): 7/10 said "Tier 3 is perfect for my size"

**ROI Validation:**
- Time savings: 5h/month x Rp 1.5M/h = Rp 7.5M/month value
- Cost: optional support (see Product 02)
- **ROI:** 18.75x (customers paying Rp 400K to get Rp 7.5M value)

### **Risk Validation**

**Risk: High Churn (>20% Annual)**
- **Hypothesis:** <10% annual churn
- **Beta test:** 0/5 churned after 3 months (0% churn)
- **Validation:** 5/5 said "This is now essential"
- **Conclusion:** Low churn risk if value delivered

**Risk: Negative Profit Margin (Service costs >optional support (see Product 02))**
- **Hypothesis:** Avg 5-8 hours/month service time
- **Beta test:** Avg 6.5 hours/month (range: 5-9 hours)
- **Labor cost:** 6.5h x Rp 50K/h = Rp 325K
- **Margin:** Rp 400K - Rp 325K = Rp 75K/month (19% margin)
- **Conclusion:** Profitable, but need to watch high-maintenance customers

**Risk: Low Tier 2->Tier 3 Upgrade Rate (<10%)**
- **Hypothesis:** 15-20% upgrade rate
- **Validation:** 3/10 discovery interviews were Tier 2 users considering upgrade (30%)
- **Beta test:** 2/5 beta testers previously used Tier 2 (40%)
- **Conclusion:** 15-20% upgrade rate is conservative, could be higher

### **Customer Lifetime Value Validation**

**LTV Calculation (3-Year Horizon):**
- Year 1: Rp 12.5M setup + Rp 4.8M recurring = Rp 17.3M
- Year 2: Rp 4.8M recurring + Rp 1M expansion = Rp 5.8M
- Year 3: Rp 4.8M recurring + Rp 1M expansion = Rp 5.8M
- **Total LTV:** Rp 28.9M

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):**
- Tier 2 upgrade: Rp 500K (sales time + marketing)
- Direct enterprise sale: Rp 2M (sales time + demos)
- Referral: Rp 1M (referral fee)
- **Avg CAC:** Rp 1.2M

**LTV:CAC Ratio:** Rp 28.9M / Rp 1.2M = **24.1x** (excellent)

**Payback Period:**
- Month 1: Rp 12.5M setup covers CAC + 10 months of service
- **Payback:** <1 month (setup fee covers all costs)
