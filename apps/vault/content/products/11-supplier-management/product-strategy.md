# Supplier Tracker Product Strategy
**Crowdsourced Supplier Price Database**

**Product Code:** D2 (Pillar 4 - Defense)
**Target Segment:** Phase 2-4, restaurants wanting supplier insights
**Pricing:** Free basic, Rp 50K/month premium

---

## Purpose

Build a proprietary database of supplier prices across Indonesia. Creates data moat that competitors can't replicate without years of effort.

## Key Features

- **Price logging:** Users log what they pay for ingredients
- **Price comparison:** See if you're paying above average
- **Supplier directory:** Who sells what, where
- **Price alerts:** Notify when ingredient prices spike
- **Negotiation leverage:** "Other restaurants pay X, why am I paying Y?"

## Market Sizing

- **TAM:** Anyone buying ingredients (100K+ businesses)
- **SAM:** 20,000 restaurants (willing to share/view data)
- **SOM:** 500-1,000 contributors by Year 2

## Pricing (Freemium)

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | Rp 0 | Contribute prices, see basic averages |
| Premium | Rp 50K/month | Full price database, alerts, reports |

## Moat Strength

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Replication Time** | 2-3 years (need critical mass) |
| **Data Uniqueness** | High (no other source exists) |
| **Network Effects** | Strong (more users = more data = more value) |

## Revenue Projections

- Year 1: Rp 5M (limited data, building network)
- Year 2: Rp 25M (500 premium subscribers)
- Year 3: Rp 75M (1,500 premium subscribers)

## Strategic Value

- **Competitive moat:** Competitors can't replicate without user base
- **Trust builder:** "We know the market" positions us as authority
- **Upsell driver:** Users want full analytics after seeing price insights

## Dependencies

- Requires user network (Chicken & egg problem)
- Launch WITH analytics platform (not standalone first)

---

**Status:** Backlog (Sprint 4-5)
**Dependencies:** User base from Full SaaS
**Build Estimate:** 3 weeks (AI-codeable)
