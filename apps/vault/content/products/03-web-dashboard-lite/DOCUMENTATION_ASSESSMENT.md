## 2. Category-by-Category Assessment

### 2.1 Business Intelligence [x] CRITICAL GAP (0 files, 0 lines)

**Status:** COMPLETELY MISSING - No directory exists

**What's Missing:**
1. [x] Market Sizing Validation (TAM/SAM/SOM for freemium model)
2. [x] Unit Economics Deep-Dive (LTV, CAC, payback, cohort retention by tier)
3. [x] Freemium Conversion Analysis (funnel metrics, free  ->  Starter  ->  Pro conversion rates)
4. [x] Revenue Projections (Year 1-3 MRR/ARR by tier, profitability timeline)
5. [x] Churn Analysis (cohort retention curves, reasons by tier)
6. [x] Competitive Benchmarking (vs Power BI SaaS, Tableau, local Indonesian analytics tools)

**What Exists Elsewhere:**
- pricing-strategy.md has basic LTV/CAC (Starter: Rp 3.6M LTV, 6:1 ratio; Pro: Rp 7.2M LTV, 8:1 ratio)
- But NO comprehensive financial model like Product 02's subscription-unit-economics.md

**Impact if Not Fixed:**
- Can't validate pricing (Rp 200K Starter, Rp 300K Pro)
- No revenue forecasts for investor/stakeholder communication
- Can't predict breakeven point or profitability timeline
- No data to validate 20% free -> paid conversion assumption

**Recommended Priority 1 Documents:**
1. `business-intelligence/market-sizing-validation.md` - TAM/SAM/SOM for freemium model
2. `business-intelligence/freemium-unit-economics.md` - LTV/CAC/margins by tier, cohort analysis
3. `business-intelligence/revenue-projections.md` - Year 1-3 MRR/ARR, profitability path

---

### 2.2 Legal [x] CRITICAL GAP (2 files, ~100 lines - PLACEHOLDERS)

**Status:** STUB ONLY - References non-existent platform ToS

**What Exists:**
- `legal/freemium-terms.md` (47 lines) - Placeholder referencing `../../company/legal/terms-of-service.md` (doesn't exist)
- `legal/README.md` (~50 lines, guessed) - Category index

**What's Missing:**
1. [x] Comprehensive Freemium Terms & Conditions (subscription terms, free tier limitations, upgrade/downgrade)
2. [x] Privacy Policy (data collection, storage, user consent - critical for Indonesian market)
3. [x] SLA Definitions (uptime commitments by tier: Free = no SLA, Starter = 99%, Pro = 99.5%)
4. [x] Cancellation & Refund Policy (paid tier cancellations, downgrades, pro-rated refunds)
5. [x] Acceptable Use Policy (prevents abuse of free tier)

**Impact if Not Fixed:**
- Cannot legally launch freemium product (no enforceable ToS)
- Privacy violations (Indonesia Personal Data Protection Law 2022 compliance)
- Support disputes (no SLA = customer complaints with no resolution framework)
- Refund disputes (no policy = case-by-case chaos)

**Recommended Priority 1 Documents:**
1. `legal/freemium-terms.md` (REPLACE placeholder) - Full T&C for free + paid tiers
2. `legal/privacy-policy.md` - Indonesian law compliance (PDP Law 2022)

2. [x] Customer FAQ (pre-signup questions: "Is my data safe?", "Can I downgrade?", "What if I need more metrics?")
3. [x] Comparison Sheet (Free vs Starter vs Pro - customer-facing table)
4. [x] ROI Calculator (savings from using Lite vs hiring analyst)

**Impact if Not Fixed:**
- Sales team lacks collateral for customer conversations
- Prospects can't self-educate (high support load)
- Conversion friction (unclear value prop  ->  low free -> paid conversion)

**Recommended Priority 1 Documents:**
1. `marketing/04-customer-faq.md` - Pre-signup questions (freemium model, data privacy, upgrades)

## 7. Recommendations

### 7.1 Immediate Actions (Before Week 3 Launch)

**Week 1 (Days 1-2): Business Intelligence** (10-12 hours)
1. Create `business-intelligence/` directory
2. Write `market-sizing-validation.md` (validate 500 free signups, 20% conversion)
3. Write `freemium-unit-economics.md` (LTV/CAC/margins by tier, cohort retention)
4. Write `revenue-projections.md` (Year 1-3 MRR/ARR, profitability timeline)

**Week 1 (Days 3-4): Legal & Compliance** (7-8 hours)
1. Replace `legal/freemium-terms.md` placeholder with full T&C
2. Write `legal/privacy-policy.md` (Indonesia PDP Law 2022 compliance)
3. Write `legal/sla-definitions.md` (Free/Starter/Pro uptime + support SLAs)
4. Write `legal/cancellation-policy.md` (downgrade/cancellation rules)

**Week 2 (Days 1-2): Customer-Facing Marketing** (4-5 hours)
1. Write `marketing/04-customer-faq.md` (freemium questions, data privacy, upgrades)
2. Write `marketing/06-freemium-comparison.md` (Free vs Starter vs Pro table)

**Total Time:** 21-25 hours (3-4 days of focused work)

---

### 7.2 Post-Launch Actions (Weeks 5-8)

**Priority 2 Work:**
- Integrations documentation (POS, cloud sync, API)
- Technical deep-dive (database, security, API reference)

**Ongoing Maintenance:**
- Update gate tracking as Gate 1B validation proceeds
- Refine pricing strategy based on actual conversion data
- Add customer case studies to `marketing/09-case-studies.md`

---

### 7.3 Quality Benchmarks (Target Standards)

**Business Intelligence:**
- Use Product 02 (R1) `subscription-unit-economics.md` as template (746 lines, comprehensive)
- Include sensitivity analysis (what if conversion drops?)
- Link to gate thresholds (Gate 1B metrics predict Year 2 profitability)

**Legal Documents:**
- Use Product 02 (R1) legal docs as template:
 - `subscription-terms.md` (532 lines)
 - `sla-definitions.md` (466 lines)
 - `cancellation-policy.md` (505 lines)
- Adapt for freemium model (free tier limitations, downgrade rules)
- Include Indonesia-specific compliance (PDP Law 2022)

**Customer-Facing Marketing:**
- Use Product 02 (R1) `customer-faq.md` as template (854 lines, comprehensive)
- Add freemium-specific questions ("What's the catch?", "Can I try before paying?")
- Visual comparison sheet (table format, easy to scan)

---

## 8. Risk Analysis

### 8.1 Risks if Priority 1 Docs Not Created

**Business Intelligence Missing  ->  Revenue Uncertainty**
- Risk: Can't validate Rp 200K/300K pricing  ->  May be too high (low conversion) or too low (leaving money on table)
- Impact: Lost revenue (10-30% potential revenue miss)
- Mitigation: Create BI docs Week 1

**Legal Docs Missing  ->  Launch Blocker**
- Risk: Cannot legally launch freemium product without enforceable ToS
- Impact: Launch delay (1-2 weeks) OR legal liability (fines, lawsuits)
- Mitigation: Create legal docs Week 1 (Day 3-4)

**Customer-Facing Marketing Missing  ->  Low Conversion**
- Risk: Prospects can't self-educate  ->  High support load + low conversion
- Impact: 20% target conversion may drop to 10% (50% revenue miss)
- Mitigation: Create FAQ + comparison sheet Week 2

---

### 8.2 Opportunity Risks (Upside if Done Well)

**Comprehensive BI Docs  ->  Confident Pricing**
- If unit economics show 30% conversion is achievable, we can confidently invest in marketing
- If LTV/CAC ratio is 8:1 (vs target 6:1), we can afford higher CAC (more aggressive growth)

**Strong Legal Foundation  ->  Customer Trust**
- Clear privacy policy  ->  Addresses "crab mentality" fear (data exposure)
- Transparent SLA  ->  Sets expectations  ->  Reduces churn

**Excellent Customer FAQ  ->  Self-Service Conversion**
- Prospects self-educate  ->  Lower support load
- Clear value prop  ->  Higher free -> paid conversion (target: 20%  ->  actual: 25%+)
