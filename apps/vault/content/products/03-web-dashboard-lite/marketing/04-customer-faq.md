## 1. Product Basics

### 1.1 What is E1 Web Dashboard Lite?

**E1 is a simple, affordable analytics dashboard for Indonesian F&B businesses with POS systems.**

Think of it as "business intelligence made easy" - you connect your POS system, and E1 automatically shows you:
- Daily sales and revenue trends
- Best-selling products
- Peak hours (when customers come most)
- Transaction patterns (average order value, payment methods)

**Who is it for?**
- Small to medium F&B businesses (restaurants, cafes, food trucks, bakeries)
- Owners who want to understand their business better
- Businesses already using a POS system (Moka, Qasir, Pawoon, or any POS with data export)

**Who is it NOT for?**
- Large enterprises needing complex analytics (use our Full SaaS product instead)
- Businesses without a POS system (you need POS data to use E1)

### 1.2 What makes E1 different from other analytics tools?

**1. Offline-First (Works Without Internet)**
- Data stored locally on your computer (SQLite database)
- Dashboard works even if internet is down
- Perfect for Indonesia's unreliable internet (especially outside Jakarta)

**2. Freemium Model (Start Free, Upgrade When Ready)**
- Free tier: 7 days of data, 5 metrics, zero cost
- Paid tiers: 30/90 days of data, more metrics, cloud sync (Rp 200K-300K/month)
- No forced upgrades, no credit card required for Free tier

**3. Designed for Indonesia**
- Pricing in Rupiah (Rp 200K/300K, not USD)
- Payment methods: Bank transfer (BCA, Mandiri, BNI), GoPay, OVO, credit card
- WhatsApp support (Starter/Pro) - no email-only support like foreign SaaS
- Data stored in Indonesia (compliant with Indonesia PDP Law 2022)

**4. Simple and Focused**
- 5-50 metrics (not 200+ like complex BI tools)
- Designed for busy restaurant owners, not data analysts
- Clean dashboard, no clutter

### 1.3 Is E1 the same as Power BI?

**No, E1 is NOT Power BI.**

**Differences:**

| Feature | E1 Web Dashboard Lite | Power BI (Full SaaS) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Complexity** | Simple (5-50 metrics) | Advanced (150+ metrics) |
| **Price** | Rp 0 - 300K/month | Rp 500K - 2M/month |
| **Target User** | Small F&B owners | Medium-large F&B chains |
| **Internet Needed** | No (offline-first) | Yes (cloud-only) |
| **Learning Curve** | 5 minutes | 2-3 hours |
| **Customization** | Limited (standard dashboards) | Unlimited (custom Power BI reports) |

**When to use E1:**
- You want simple, ready-to-use dashboards
- Budget <Rp 500K/month
- You value offline access

**When to use Power BI (Full SaaS):**
- You need custom reports and complex analytics
- Budget >Rp 500K/month
- You have multiple locations or advanced needs

**Can I upgrade from E1 to Power BI later?**
Yes! Many E1 users start with our Free tier, then upgrade to Starter/Pro, and eventually migrate to Power BI Full SaaS when their business grows. Data export is compatible (CSV format).

### 2.2 Can I really use E1 for free forever?

**Yes, the Free tier is free forever.**

No time limits, no forced upgrades, no credit card required.

**What's the catch?**

- Only 5 basic metrics (Total Sales, Transaction Count, Avg Transaction Value, Top Product, Peak Hour)
- No cloud backup (data only on your computer, lost if device fails)
- No direct support (community forum only)

**Why do we offer a Free tier?**
1. Let you try E1 risk-free before paying
2. Free tier is useful for very small businesses (even 7 days of data helps)
3. Many Free users eventually upgrade to Starter/Pro as their business grows

### 2.3 How do I know if I need Starter or Pro?

**Choose Starter if:**
- You want 30 days of historical data (vs 7 days Free)
- You need cloud backup (data safe if computer breaks)
- You want WhatsApp support (24-48 hour response)
- You need data export to Excel (for accountant, tax reporting)
- Budget: Rp 200K/month (~Rp 6,600/day)

**Choose Pro if:**
- You need 90 days of historical data (3 months of trends)
- You have multiple users (manager, owner, accountant all need access)
- You want priority support (12-24 hour response, not 24-48h)
- You need custom date ranges and advanced reports
- Budget: Rp 300K/month (~Rp 10,000/day)

### 10.2 My POS data won't upload

**Common Causes:**

**1. Wrong File Format**
- E1 supports CSV/Excel only
- PDF/images not supported
- Solution: Export data from POS as CSV/Excel

**2. Missing Required Columns**
- E1 needs: Date, Time, Amount (minimum)
- Solution: Check CSV template: [[e1-csv-template|E1 CSV Template]]

**3. Date Format Issue**
- E1 expects: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-01-15)
- Your POS may export: DD/MM/YYYY (e.g., 15/01/2025)
- Solution: E1 auto-detects most formats, but if upload fails, reformat dates in Excel

**4. File Too Large**
- Free tier: 10,000 transactions max
- Starter/Pro: Unlimited
- Solution: Upgrade to Starter/Pro, or split CSV into smaller files

**Still stuck?**
- Starter/Pro: Email CSV sample to support@powerbifnb.com (we'll help you fix it)

### 10.3 Cloud sync not working (Starter/Pro only)

**Check 1: Internet Connection**
- Ensure you're connected to internet
- Test: Open browser, visit google.com

**Check 2: Cloud Sync Enabled**
- Settings  ->  Privacy  ->  Cloud Sync  ->  Make sure "Enabled"

**Check 3: Supabase Status**
- Visit: status.supabase.com (check if Supabase is down)
- If down: Wait for Supabase to restore service, E1 will auto-sync when back online

**Check 4: Storage Quota**
- Free tier: N/A (no cloud sync)
- Starter/Pro: Unlimited storage (quota should not be issue)

**Still not syncing?**
- Contact support: support@powerbifnb.com (include screenshot of Settings  ->  Privacy  ->  Cloud Sync)

### 10.4 I forgot my password

**Reset Password:**
1. Open E1 app (or visit: app.powerbifnb.com)
