## Example Case Study #1: Bu Siti (Food Cost Optimization)

### Customer Profile
- **Name:** Bu Siti Rahayu
- **Business:** Warung Makan Sederhana
- **Location:** Bandung, West Java
- **Size:** 3 outlets, 20 staff
- **Segment:** Phase 2 Kecil (scaling, Rp 150M annual revenue)

### Challenge
**Before Dashboard Lite, Bu Siti struggled with invisible losses:**

She ran a successful warung with 3 outlets, but despite good sales, profit margins were shrinking. She suspected food waste or theft but had no data to prove it.

**Specific issues:**
- Manual Excel tracking took 10+ hours/week
- Didn't know food cost % per menu item
- Assumed "best-selling = most profitable" (wrong!)
- No visibility into which outlet was underperforming

**Impact:**
- 10 hours/week spent on Excel (Rp 500K opportunity cost)
- Estimated Rp 1-2M/month lost to unclear food costs
- Staff friction (accused wrong people of theft based on guesses)

### Solution
**Discovery:** Bu Siti found Dashboard Lite through Facebook group post in "Komunitas Pemilik Warung Makan"

**Onboarding:** Signed up for free tier, installed in 5 minutes, started inputting daily sales.

**Key features used:**
1. **Top 5 Menu analysis** - Discovered Ayam Geprek was #1 seller
2. **Food Cost % calculator** - Input ingredient costs, realized Ayam Geprek had 45% food cost (should be 28-32%)
3. **Per-outlet dashboard** - Compared 3 outlets, found Outlet 2 had consistently higher food cost (supplier issue, not theft!)

**Actions taken:**
- Changed Ayam Geprek supplier (better bulk pricing)
- Renegotiated contracts with 2 other suppliers
- Standardized portion sizes across outlets
- Implemented daily food cost tracking (vs monthly before)

### Results
**Quantifiable outcomes:**
- **Food cost reduced:** 45% → 32% (13 percentage point improvement)
- **Monthly savings:** Rp 2.1M (based on Rp 16M monthly Ayam Geprek sales × 13%)
- **Time saved:** 8 hours/week (Excel → 5min/day dashboard input)
- **Staff morale:** Improved (no more false accusations)

**Qualitative benefits:**
- "Now I know exactly which menu is profitable—not guessing anymore"
- "Can make decisions based on data, not gut feel"
- "Discovered Outlet 2 supplier was overcharging—saved Rp 500K/month just from that!"

**ROI:**
- Investment: Rp 0 (used Free tier for 2 months, then upgraded to Premium Rp 250K/mo)
- Return: Rp 2.1M savings/month + 8 hrs/week saved (Rp 400K value) = Rp 2.5M/month
- **ROI: 10x** (Rp 250K → Rp 2.5M monthly value)

### Quote
> _"Dashboard ini buka mata saya—selama ini menu paling laris ternyata yang paling rugi! Dalam 1 bulan saya hemat Rp 2 juta cuma dari ganti supplier. Sekarang saya gak akan pernah buka resto tanpa analytics lagi."_

## Example Case Study #2: Mas Budi (Staff Performance)

### Customer Profile
- **Name:** Mas Budi Santoso
- **Business:** Cafe & Resto "Kopi Kita"
- **Location:** Jakarta Selatan
- **Size:** 1 outlet, 15 staff (3 shifts)
- **Segment:** Phase 1 Mikro (single outlet, Rp 100M annual revenue)

### Challenge
**Mas Budi suspected night shift was underperforming but had no proof:**

He ran a busy cafe with 3 shifts (morning/afternoon/night). Revenue seemed consistent, but he had a gut feeling the night shift staff wasn't as productive. Excel couldn't show per-staff or per-shift breakdowns easily.

**Specific issues:**
- No way to compare staff performance objectively
- Suspected night shift was slow, but couldn't prove it
- Afraid to confront staff without data (might be wrong + damage morale)
- Scheduling was guesswork ("who should work the busy hours?")

**Impact:**
- Potential revenue loss (if night shift was truly underperforming)
- Staff morale risk (false accusations)
- Inefficient scheduling (putting best staff on wrong shifts)

### Solution
**Discovery:** Friend referred Mas Budi after seeing her success with Dashboard Lite

**Onboarding:** Installed free tier, impressed by Staff Performance metric

**Key features used:**
1. **Staff Performance tracker** - Sales per staff member, per shift
2. **Busiest Hours analysis** - Identified peak times (7-9 PM)
3. **Revenue by shift** - Morning vs Afternoon vs Night comparison

**Actions taken:**
- Analyzed 2 weeks of data
- Discovered night shift staff were EQUAL to day shift (his assumption was wrong!)
- Real issue: Fewer customers at night (not staff laziness)
- Changed marketing: Launched "Happy Hour 8-10 PM" promotion
- Adjusted staff scheduling: Put experienced staff on busiest hours (7-9 PM)

### Results
**Quantifiable outcomes:**
- **Staff morale:** Improved (avoided false accusations)
- **Night revenue increase:** 15% (after Happy Hour promo based on data insights)
- **Better scheduling:** Right staff at right times
- **Decision confidence:** 100% (all staffing decisions now data-backed)

**Qualitative benefits:**
- "I almost made a huge mistake—I was going to fire night shift staff, but data showed they were fine!"
- "Now I know EXACTLY when to schedule my best barista (7-9 PM peak)"
- "Staff trust me more because I make fair decisions based on numbers, not feelings"

**ROI:**
- Investment: Rp 0 (Free tier sufficient for his needs)
- Return: 15% night revenue increase = Rp 500K/month + avoided bad firing decision (priceless)
- **ROI: ∞** (Rp 0 investment, Rp 500K+ return)

### Quote
> _"Dashboard literally saved me from firing good staff! Ternyata masalahnya bukan staff malas, tapi marketing kurang. Sekarang happy hour jalan, revenue naik, dan staff happy. Thank you Dashboard Lite!"_
> — **Mas Budi Santoso, Owner Cafe & Resto "Kopi Kita" (Jakarta)**

### Visual
