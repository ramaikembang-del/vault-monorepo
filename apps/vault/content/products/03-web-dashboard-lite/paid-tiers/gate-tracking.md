# Gate 1B Tracking - E1 Paid Tiers

**Product:** E1 - Web Dashboard (Paid Tiers)
**Gate:** Gate 1B (E1 Lite Validation + Paid Tier Launch)
**Target Date:** Week 6 (Sprint 2 end)
**Owner:** Product Lead

---

## Gate 1B Overview

**Purpose:** Validate that E1 Lite (free tier) has traction AND paid tiers (Starter/Pro) can monetize.

**Context:** Gate 1B has two parts:
1. **E1 Lite validation** (already tracked in E1 main docs - 100+ free users)
2. **Paid tier conversion** (this document - Starter/Pro subscribers)

**Strategic Importance:** Paid tiers fund the business. Free tier is marketing. Must prove 20%+ pay.

## Success Criteria (Gate 1B - Paid Tiers)

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Excellent | Pass | Current | Status |
|--------|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| **Free  ->  Starter Conversion** | 25%+ | 20% | 0% | Not launched |
| **Starter Subscribers** | 25+ | 20 | 0 | |
| **Pro Subscribers** | 8+ | 5 | 0 | |
| **Total MRR (Paid Tiers)** | Rp 6M+ | Rp 4.5M | Rp 0 | |
| **Starter  ->  Pro Conversion** | 35%+ | 30% | N/A | ⚪ Pending |

**Metric Definitions:**

**1. Free  ->  Starter Conversion:** % of free users (7+ days active) who upgrade to Starter within 30 days
- **Why 20% minimum?** Industry standard for freemium SaaS is 15-25%. Below 20% = pricing too high OR free tier too good.
- **Calculation:** (# Starter subscribers Ã· # active Free users) Ã— 100%

**2. Starter Subscribers:** Total paying Starter tier customers
- **Why 20 minimum?** 20 Ã— Rp 200K = Rp 4M MRR (covers basic ops + support)

**3. Pro Subscribers:** Total paying Pro tier customers
- **Why 5 minimum?** Proves Pro features (custom reports, multi-user) have demand

**4. Total MRR:** Monthly Recurring Revenue from paid tiers
- **Calculation:** (# Starter Ã— Rp 200K) + (# Pro Ã— Rp 300K)
- **Why Rp 4.5M minimum?** Covers full-time support, server costs, partial R&D
- **Why Rp 6M target?** Funds next product development (R2b/R2f)

**5. Starter  ->  Pro Conversion:** % of Starter users who upgrade to Pro
- **Why 30%?** Pro is 50% more expensive (Rp 200K  ->  Rp 300K). 30% upgrading = strong value perception for premium features.

**Week 6 Target:** 20+ Starter, 5+ Pro, Rp 4.5M+ MRR, 20%+ conversion

---

## Leading Indicators (Predictive Metrics)

### Indicator 1: "Locked Metric Click Rate"

**Definition:** % of free users who click on a locked Starter/Pro metric (shows interest in upgrading)

**Target:** >40% (If <20%, free tier has all they need = poor upsell pressure)

**Weekly Tracking:**
| Week | Free Users | Locked Metric Clicks | Click % |
|------|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Week 5 | | | |

**Intervention:** If <20%, reduce free tier to 3 metrics (currently 5) to create more upgrade pressure.

---

### Indicator 2: "History Limit Hit Rate"

**Definition:** % of free users who try to view >7 days history (blocked by free tier limit)

**Target:** >50% (If <30%, 7-day history is sufficient = no upgrade pressure)

**Intervention:** If <30%, reduce free tier to 3-day history.

---

### Indicator 3: "Upgrade Modal Conversion"

**Definition:** When user clicks locked metric  ->  sees upgrade modal, % who click "Upgrade Now"

**Target:** >15% (modal-to-checkout conversion)

**Funnel:**
```
100 users click locked metric
 ->  40 click "View Plans" in modal (40% interest)
 ->  15 complete checkout (37.5% modal -> checkout, 15% total)
```

## Decision Trees (Gate 1B Meeting - Week 6 End)

### Scenario A: PASS (Green Light) [x]

**Conditions (ALL must be met):**
- [x] Starter Subscribers >= 20
- [x] Pro Subscribers >= 5
- [x] MRR >= Rp 4.5M
- [x] Free  ->  Starter Conversion >= 20%
- [x] Starter Churn <15% (Month 1)

**Decision:** **Continue E1 Paid Tiers + Begin Accounting Module (R2a)**

**Next Actions:**
1. Scale E1 marketing (Rp 10M/month ad spend)
2. Build R2a Simple P&L (already validated via E1 success)
3. Test E1+R2a bundle pricing (Rp 250K)
4. Hire dedicated support rep for Starter/Pro tiers

**Budget Allocation:**
- E1 Marketing Scale: Rp 10M/month (CAC Rp 500K acceptable at 6:1 LTV:CAC)
- R2a Development: Rp 20M (4 weeks Sprint 2)
- Support Hire: Rp 8M/month

---

### Scenario B: PARTIAL PASS (Yellow Light) [!]

**Conditions:**
- [!] Starter Subscribers: 15-19 (below target but not zero)
- [!] Conversion: 15-19% (marginal)
- [x] Pro Subscribers >= 5 (power users exist)
- [!] MRR: Rp 3.5-4.4M (below pass but growing)

**Analysis:** **Product works for some, but pricing or free tier balance needs adjustment.**

**Decision:** **Fix conversion funnel, delay R2a 4 weeks, re-evaluate.**

**Next Actions (Pivot):**
1. **Pricing Test:** Launch "Starter Lite" Rp 150K tier (10 metrics, 30-day history)
2. **Free Tier Adjustment:** Reduce to 3 metrics (from 5) to increase upgrade pressure
3. **First Month 50% Off Promo:** Rp 100K first month Starter to boost conversions
4. **DO NOT launch R2a yet** - Wait until E1 paid tiers hit 20+ subs

**Re-Evaluation:** Gate 1B.1 in 4 weeks (Week 10)

---

### Scenario C: FAIL (Red Light) [x]

**Conditions (ANY of these):**
- [x] Starter Subscribers < 10 (very low demand)
- [x] Free  ->  Starter Conversion < 10% (pricing WAY too high or free too good)
- [x] Starter Churn >30% Month 1 (paying but not seeing value)

**Analysis:** **Freemium model broken. Either pricing wrong OR free tier cannibalized paid.**

**Decision:** **Deep Pivot or Kill Paid Tiers.**

**Options:**

**Option 1: Paid-Only Model (Kill Free Tier)**
- Shut down Free tier entirely
- E1 becomes paid-only: Rp 150K/month (single tier, no freemium)
- Target Phase 2+ businesses willing to pay (smaller TAM but higher ARPU)
- **Risk:** Lose viral growth from free tier

**Option 2: Enterprise-Only Pivot**
- Free tier stays for Mikro (Phase 1-2)
- Build "E1 Enterprise" for Phase 3-4: Rp 1M/month (custom dashboards, dedicated support)
- Target multi-outlet chains (10+ locations)
- **Risk:** Different product, requires enterprise sales team

**Option 3: Bundle-Only Strategy**
- Stop standalone E1 paid tiers
- Only sell E1 as bundle with R2a: Rp 250K total (mandatory)
- Hypothesis: Standalone analytics not valued, but bundled with accounting = compelling
- **Risk:** Smaller addressable market (only accounting-interested users)

**Re-Evaluation:** If pivot chosen, Gate 1B.2 in 8 weeks (Week 14)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: "Free Tier Too Good" (Low Conversion)

**Early Signal:** <15% conversion after Week 5

**Mitigation:**
- Reduce free metrics from 5  ->  3 (keep only Total Revenue, Customers, Best-Seller)
- Reduce history from 7 days  ->  3 days (force upgrade for week-overs)
- Add "powered by E1" watermark on free tier reports (professional users upgrade to remove)

---

### Risk 2: "Pro Tier Too Expensive" (Low Starter -> Pro)

**Early Signal:** <20% Starter -> Pro conversion after Week 6

**Mitigation:**
- Launch "Starter Plus" Rp 250K tier (middle ground - 25 metrics, 60-day history)
- Offer "Try Pro 14 Days Free" to all Starter users
- Bundle Pro with R2a at steep discount (Rp 350K combined vs Rp 400K standalone)
