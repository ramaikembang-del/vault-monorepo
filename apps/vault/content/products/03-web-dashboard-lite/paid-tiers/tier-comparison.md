## Upgrade Decision Guide

### When to Upgrade from Free → Starter?

**Signals you're ready:**
- You're making monthly decisions (pricing, menu changes, staffing)
- The 7-day history is too short ("What was revenue last month?")
- You want to compare month-over-month performance
- You need to justify spending (e.g., "Is delivery profitable?")

**ROI Example:**
> Discovery: Delivery channel has 45% COGS vs 30% dine-in (too thin margin).
> Action: Reduce delivery menu, focus on dine-in.
> Result: Rp 500K/month margin improvement.
> Starter cost: Rp 200K/month → 2.5× ROI

---

### When to Upgrade from Starter → Pro?

**Signals you're ready:**
- Opening 2nd outlet (need multi-user access for manager)
- Want custom reports (e.g., profit per square meter, revenue per menu category)
- Need longer history for seasonal analysis (Ramadan vs normal months)
- Have dedicated ops manager who needs daily data

**ROI Example:**
> Discovery: Staff productivity varies 40% between shifts (custom metric).
> Action: Optimize staffing schedule, reduce slow-shift labor.
> Result: Rp 1.5M/month labor savings.
> Pro cost: Rp 300K/month → 5× ROI
