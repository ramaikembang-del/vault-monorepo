## 3. Downgrade Process

### 3.1 Downgrade Types

**Three Downgrade Scenarios:**
1. **Pro → Starter:** Keep paid tier, reduce features and cost
2. **Starter/Pro → Free:** Downgrade to free tier, lose paid features
3. **Trial → Free:** Trial expires without payment, auto-downgrade

### 3.2 Pro → Starter Downgrade

**How to Downgrade:**

**Timing:**

- **No recovery:** Once deleted, data cannot be restored

**No Prorated Refund:**
