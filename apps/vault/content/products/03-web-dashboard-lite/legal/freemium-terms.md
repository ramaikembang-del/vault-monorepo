## 11. General Provisions

### 11.1 Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with the [[products/01-power-bi-template/legal/02-privacy-policy|Privacy Policy]] and [[products/01-power-bi-template/legal/03-sla-definitions|SLA Definitions]], constitute the entire agreement between you and Power BI FnB Growth regarding the Service.

### 11.5 Waiver

Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not waive our right to enforce it later.
