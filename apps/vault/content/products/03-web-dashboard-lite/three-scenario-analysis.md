## Conservative Scenario (Baseline - Main Documentation)

**Use Case:** Official financial planning, risk-mitigated projections

### Assumptions

**Freemium Funnel:**
- Year 1: 500 signups  ->  100 paid (20% conversion)
- Year 2: 1,250 signups  ->  250 paid (20% conversion)
- Year 3: 2,500 signups  ->  500 paid (20% conversion)

**Pricing Tiers:**
- Free: 7-day history, 5 metrics, mobile-only
- Starter (Rp 200K/mo): 30-day history, 20 metrics
- Pro (Rp 300K/mo): 90-day history, unlimited metrics

**Tier Mix:**
- 60% Starter, 40% Pro
- **Blended: Rp 240K/mo**

**Churn:**
- Starter: 10% monthly (18-month lifetime)
- Pro: 8% monthly (24-month lifetime)

**Key Constraints:**
- 500 freemium = 0.33% of 150K TAM (very low for FREE product)
- 20% conversion = low end of business-critical SaaS
- No viral growth (K = 0)

### Revenue Breakdown

| Year | Freemium | Paid | MRR | ARR | Growth |
|------|----------|------|-----|-----|--------|
| Year 1 | 500 | 100 | Rp 20M | Rp 240M | - |
| Year 2 | 1,250 | 250 | Rp 62.5M | Rp 750M | +213% |
| Year 3 | 2,500 | 500 | Rp 125M | Rp 1,500M | +100% |

**Unit Economics:**
- Freemium CAC: Rp 150K per signup
- Paid CAC: Rp 750K (Rp 150K / 20%)
- Blended LTV: Rp 5.04M (60% Starter Rp 3.6M + 40% Pro Rp 7.2M)
- **LTV/CAC: 6.7:1**

---

## Realistic Scenario (Team of 3 Executing Well)

**Use Case:** Aggressive but achievable targets, internal team OKRs

### What Changes from Conservative

**1. WhatsApp Viral Loops Activated**
- "Share with 3 friends  ->  unlock 14-day history" feature
- WhatsApp business groups = natural sharing
- **K = 1.0** (each user brings 1 more over lifetime)
- **Result: 5,000 freemium Year 1** (10Ã— conservative)

**2. Better Conversion Rate**
- Business-critical tool positioning (70% Mikro failure rate = survival tool)
- Faster limits: 7-day history  ->  5-day, 5 metrics  ->  3 metrics
- **35% conversion** (vs 20%, still below 40% ceiling for business-critical SaaS)

**3. Higher Pricing**
- Starter: Rp 250K/mo (vs Rp 200K, still cheaper than Moka Rp 300K)
- Pro: Rp 400K/mo (vs Rp 300K)
- Premium tier: Rp 600K/mo (multi-location, API access) - 15% of paid users
- **Blended: Rp 310K/mo**

**4. Faster Freemium Growth**
- Year 1: 5,000  ->  Year 3: 50,000 (network effects compound)
- WhatsApp sharing in F&B business groups drives exponential growth

### Revenue Breakdown

| Year | Freemium | Paid | MRR | ARR | vs Conservative |
|------|----------|------|-----|-----|-----------------|
| Year 1 | 5,000 | 1,750 | Rp 542.5M | Rp 6,510M | +Rp 6,270M (+2,613%) |
| Year 2 | 20,000 | 7,000 | Rp 2,170M | Rp 26,040M | +Rp 25,290M (+3,372%) |
| Year 3 | 50,000 | 17,500 | Rp 5,425M | Rp 65,100M | +Rp 63,600M (+4,240%) |

**Why This is Realistic:**

**Freemium Acquisition:**
- TAM: 150K Mikro F&B
- 5,000 users = 3.3% of TAM for FREE product (still conservative)
- WhatsApp viral loops cost ZERO (organic growth)
- Comparable: Canva scaled to 100M users with similar freemium model

**35% Conversion:**
- Business-critical tools: 30-40% typical
- E1 solves survival (70% failure rate) - not nice-to-have
- Free tier hits limits fast (5-day history, 3 metrics)
- **Industry-standard conversion for critical tools**

### Team Requirements

**Can a team of 3 support 1,750 paid users?** [x] **YES (with automation)**

**Support Load:**
- 1,750 users Ã— 2 tickets/month = 3,500 tickets/month
- With chatbot + FAQ: 50% self-serve = 1,750 manual/month = 80/day
- **1 CS person + automation = doable**

**Tech Load:**
- 5,000 freemium + 1,750 paid = 6,750 total users
- Infrastructure scales automatically (same cost for 500 or 6,750)
- **1 tech person = doable**

---

## Aggressive Scenario (Everything Goes Right)

**Use Case:** Investor TAM potential, Rp 200B+ ARR business case

### What Changes from Realistic

**1. Paid Marketing Budget**
- Increase from Rp 7M/month to Rp 100M/month
- WhatsApp ads: Rp 10K CAC (vs Rp 150K organic)
- **10,000 freemium Year 1** @ Rp 10K CAC = Rp 100M spend

**2. Tighter Feature Gating**
- 3 metrics free (vs 5) - lock essential metrics behind paywall
- 3-day history (vs 7-day) - forces upgrade faster
- **40% conversion** (still within 40-45% ceiling for critical SaaS)

**3. Premium Pricing Tier Mix**
- 40% Starter @ Rp 250K/mo
- 40% Pro @ Rp 400K/mo
- 20% Premium @ Rp 600K/mo (multi-location, benchmarks, API)
- **Blended: Rp 400K/mo**

**4. Exponential Viral Growth**
- K = 1.5-2.0 (strong WhatsApp network effects)
- Each user brings 1.5-2 more over lifetime
- **100,000 freemium Year 3**

### Revenue Breakdown

| Year | Freemium | Paid | MRR | ARR | vs Conservative |
|------|----------|------|-----|-----|-----------------|
| Year 1 | 10,000 | 4,000 | Rp 1,600M | Rp 19,200M | +Rp 18,960M (+7,900%) |
| Year 2 | 40,000 | 16,000 | Rp 6,400M | Rp 76,800M | +Rp 76,050M (+10,140%) |
| Year 3 | 100,000 | 40,000 | Rp 16,000M | Rp 192,000M | +Rp 190,500M (+12,700%) |

**This is a Rp 200B+ ARR business by Year 3.**

### Unit Economics (Aggressive)

- Freemium CAC: Rp 10K (paid ads scale)
- Paid CAC: Rp 25K (Rp 10K / 40%)
- LTV: Rp 400K/mo Ã— 24 months avg = Rp 9.6M
- **LTV/CAC: 384:1**  -> Exceptional economics

### Team Requirements

**Can a team of 3 support 4,000 paid users?** [x] **NO**

**Required Scaling:**
- CS team: 5-8 people Year 1, 15-25 people Year 3
- Tech team: 3-5 people (infrastructure, features)
- Marketing team: 3-5 people (Rp 100M/month ad spend management)
- **Total headcount: 10-15 people Year 1, 25-40 people Year 3**

**When to Hire:** If hitting Realistic (1,750 paid) by Month 6, hire aggressively

## Why E1 Has Largest Upside: Market Analysis

### Factor 1: Massive TAM (150K vs 30K for A1)

**TAM Comparison:**
- A1: 30,000 restaurants (tech-savvy, Phase 2-3)
- E1: 150,000 Mikro F&B (accessible, Phase 1)
- **E1 TAM = 5Ã— larger**

**Addressability:**
- A1 requires Power BI skills (barrier to entry)
- E1 requires only smartphone + WhatsApp (100% have)
- **E1 is easier to sell, faster to adopt**

---

### Factor 2: WhatsApp Viral Coefficient Potential

**Why WhatsApp Changes Everything:**

**For A1 (Power BI Template):**
- Sharing is awkward (email file, technical barrier)
- K = 0.3-0.5 max (referral programs needed)

**For E1 (Mobile Dashboard):**
- Sharing is natural ("Check out my dashboard screenshot in group)
- Indonesian F&B owners already in WhatsApp business groups
- **K = 1.5-2.0 possible** (viral spread in groups)

**Impact:**
- 1,000 users with K = 0.5  ->  1,500 users over 12 months (+50%)
- 1,000 users with K = 1.5  ->  2,500 users over 12 months (+150%)
- **3Ã— difference in growth from same starting point**

---

### Factor 3: Freemium = ZERO Marginal Acquisition Cost

**Cost Structure:**

**A1 (One-Time):**
- Every customer costs Rp 235K CAC
- 650 customers Year 3 = Rp 152M total CAC spend

**E1 (Freemium):**
- First 500 cost Rp 150K each = Rp 75M
- Next 4,500 from viral = Rp 0 (organic)
- **Same user count, 95% lower cost**

**Scalability:**
- A1: Linear cost (every customer = CAC spend)
- E1: Exponential (viral users = free growth)
- **E1 scales better as you grow**

---

### Factor 4: Business-Critical = 35-40% Conversion (Not 20%)

**Conversion Rate Benchmarks:**

**"Nice-to-Have" Tools (Dropbox, Evernote):**
- Free tier is sufficient for most
- Conversion: 3-5%

**"Business-Critical" Tools (Stripe, Mailchimp, Analytics):**
- Free tier intentionally limited
- Conversion: 30-40%

**E1 is Business-Critical Because:**
- 70% Mikro failure rate (survival tool, not nice-to-have)
- Free tier 5-day history runs out DAY 6 (immediate pain)
- Food Cost % locked (metric #1 for profitability = behind paywall)
- **This drives 35-40% conversion, not 20%**

---

---

## Pricing Validation: Why Customers Pay Rp 250K-600K/mo

### Alternative 1: Moka Analytics (Competitor)

**Moka Pricing:** Rp 300K/month
- Desktop-only (not mobile)
- Online-only (not offline)
- Generic POS analytics (not F&B-specific)

**E1 Pro at Rp 400K/month:**
- Mobile-first (owner checks on phone)
- Offline-capable (works without internet)
- F&B-specific metrics (Food Cost %, benchmarks)
- **Better product, still cheaper than market**

---

### Alternative 2: DIY Excel

**Time Cost:**
- 10-15 hours/month manual data entry + calc
- Owner time value: Rp 100-200K/hour
- **Monthly cost: Rp 1-3M** in owner time

**E1 Starter at Rp 250K/month:**
- **Saves Rp 750K-2.75M/month** in owner time
- Clear ROI: 3-11Ã— payback

---

### Alternative 3: No Analytics (Fly Blind)

**Cost of Not Knowing:**
- 70% Mikro F&B fail in 2 years
- Primary reason: Cash flow mismanagement, inventory waste
- **E1 prevents failure = infinite value**

**Willingness to Pay:**
- Rp 250K/month = Rp 3M/year
- vs Business closure = Rp 50-200M loss (inventory, setup, reputation)
- **Rp 3M insurance = 1.5-6% of failure cost**

**Conclusion:** Rp 250-600K/month is CHEAP for survival tool
