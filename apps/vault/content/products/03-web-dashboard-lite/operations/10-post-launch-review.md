## 2. Launch Goals vs Actual Results

### 2.1 User Acquisition

| Metric | Target (Week 4) | Actual | Variance | Status |
|--------|----------------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Free Tier Signups** | 300 | [XXX] | [+/-XX%] | [[x]/[x]] |
| **Paid Conversions (Starter)** | 40 | [XX] | [+/-XX%] | [[x]/[x]] |

| **Paid Conversion Rate** | 20% (60/300) | [XX%] | [+/-XX%] | [[x]/[x]] |

**Analysis:**
- [If exceeded target]: *"Free signups exceeded target due to [reason: viral social media post, press coverage, partner referrals]. Conversion rate slightly below target - investigate activation issues."*
- [If missed target]: *"Signups below target. Root causes: [1. Lower ad performance than expected, 2. Website SEO not ranking yet, 3. Sales team ramp-up slower than planned]."*

### 2.2 Revenue

| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Actual | Variance | Status |
|--------|-----------------|--------|----------|--------|
| **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)** | Rp 10,000,000 | [Rp X,XXX,XXX] | [+/-XX%] | [[x]/[x]] |

| **Pro MRR** | Rp 2,000,000 | [Rp X,XXX,XXX] | | |
| **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)** | Rp 200,000 | [Rp XXX,XXX] | | |

**Analysis:**

| **Avg Session Duration** | 8 minutes | [X min] | [[x]/[x]] |
| **CSV Imports per User (Week 1)** | 3 imports | [X] | [[x]/[x]] |

**Analysis:**
- [Example]: *"Activation rate at 65% (below 70% target). 35% of free signups never imported a CSV. Action: Improve onboarding email sequence."*

## 4. What Didn't Go Well (Challenges)

### 4.1 Lower-Than-Expected Paid Conversion (18% vs 20% target)

**Result:** [XX% conversion (target: 20%)]

**Root Causes:**
1. **Unclear Value Proposition:** [XX% of churned users said "not sure why I need Pro tier"]
 - Free tier (7 days data) sufficient for small warungs
 - Pro tier (90 days data + multi-outlet) overkill for single-outlet businesses

2. **Pricing Confusion:** [XX% of users confused by Starter vs Pro difference]
 - Comparison sheet not clear on when to upgrade

3. **Delayed Activation:** [XX% of free users didn't complete 1st CSV import within 7 days]
 - Free tier expired before they saw value
 - Onboarding emails not compelling enough

**Impact:**
- Lost potential MRR: Rp 800,000 (4 users who didn't convert @ Rp 200K each)

**Action Items:**

 - Day 5: "Upgrade before your data expires" (urgency)

**Owner:** Marketing Team
**Due Date:** February 15, 2025

### 4.2 CSV Import Confusion (30% of Support Tickets)

**Result:** [XX support tickets about CSV import issues]

**Root Causes:**
1. **POS Export Instructions Unclear:** Users don't know how to export CSV from their POS
 - Moka: [X tickets] - Users can't find "Export" button
 - Qasir: [X tickets] - Export format is Excel (.xlsx), not CSV
 - Pawoon: [X tickets] - Date format incompatible (DD/MM/YYYY vs YYYY-MM-DD)

2. **Auto-Detection Failures:** [X% of CSVs failed auto-detection]
 - Custom POS systems (not Moka/Qasir/Pawoon) have unique formats
 - Manual mapping UI confusing

3. **Error Messages Unhelpful:** *"Import failed: Invalid format"* (no guidance on how to fix)

**Owner:** Product Team
**Due Date:** February 20, 2025

### 4.3 Higher-Than-Expected Week 2 Churn (15%)

**Result:** [XX users churned in Week 2 (15% churn rate)]

**Root Causes (from exit surveys):**
1. **"Tidak lihat value"** ([40%] of churned users)
 - Imported CSV once, saw dashboard, then never came back
 - No "aha moment" (insight that changes behavior)

2. **"Terlalu ribet untuk daily use"** ([30%])
 - Manual CSV import every day feels like a chore
 - Users want auto-sync (like Moka Analytics)

3. **"Terlalu mahal untuk fitur segini"** ([20%])
 - Rp 200K/month feels expensive for "just a dashboard"
 - Competitors (Moka) include analytics in POS bundle

4. **"Pindah ke kompetitor"** ([10%])
 - Switched to Moka Analytics (real-time sync)
 - Switched to Excel (free, but manual)

**Impact:**
- Lost MRR: Rp 3,000,000 (15 users churned @ Rp 200K each)

**Action Items:**
- Improve "aha moment" delivery:
 - Day 1 after import: Email with personalized insights (e.g., "Your top product is [X], generating 30% of revenue")
 - Week 1: Email case study (e.g., "How Bu Siti saved Rp 800K/month using E1")
- Reduce friction of daily CSV import:
 - Roadmap: Auto-sync via POS APIs (Q3 2025)
 - Short-term: Batch import (import 1 week of data at once, not daily)
- Better communicate ROI:
 - Add ROI calculator to onboarding flow (show "You can save Rp [X]/month")
 - Include ROI calculator link in pricing page

**Due Date:** March 1, 2025

## 5. Customer Feedback (Qualitative)

### 5.1 Top Feature Requests (from surveys & support tickets)

| Feature Request | Count | Priority | Planned? |
|----------------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Auto-sync with POS** (no manual CSV import) | 45 | HIGH | Q3 2025 (API integration) |
| **Inventory tracking** (track stock levels) | 30 | MEDIUM | Q4 2025 |
| **Staff performance by cashier** (already exists in Pro tier!) | 25 | N/A | Educate users |

| **Recipe costing** (calculate COGS per dish) | 15 | LOW | Not planned (out of scope) |

**Analysis:**
- **Auto-sync #1 request** (45 mentions): This is a major pain point. Accelerate API integration roadmap (target Q2 instead of Q3?)

| **"Dashboard loading lambat"** | 8 | HIGH | Optimize database queries (Week 5 sprint) |
| **"Tidak ada mobile app"** | 7 | LOW | Add to 2026 roadmap (not priority) |

**Analysis:**
- **CSV import** is #1 complaint (28 mentions)  ->  Must fix in Week 5

| **Word-of-Mouth** | [XX] | Rp 0 | [XX] | Rp 0 | ∞ |

**Analysis:**
- [Example]: *"Facebook Ads had lowest CAC (Rp 50K per free signup, Rp 250K per paid user). Google Ads higher CAC (Rp 80K per free signup) but higher quality leads (25% conversion vs FB 18%). SEO generated 50 signups at Rp 0 CAC - highest ROI channel."*

## 10. Strategic Decisions

### 10.1 Pricing Adjustment (Under Consideration)

**Option 1: Extend Free Tier (7  ->  14 Days)**
- **Pro:** More time for users to see value  ->  higher conversion
- **Con:** Some users may exploit free tier longer (delay payment)
- **Decision:** [x] APPROVED - Implement Week 5

**Option 2: Discount First 3 Months (20% Off)**
- **Pro:** Lower barrier to paid conversion
- **Con:** Trains users to expect discounts  ->  harder to charge full price later
- **Decision:** (wait)¸ ON HOLD - Test after free tier extension first

**Option 3: Add "Starter Plus" Tier (Rp 250K, 60 Days Data)**
- **Pro:** Fills gap between Starter (30 days) and Pro (90 days)
- **Con:** More pricing tiers = more confusion
- **Decision:** [x] REJECTED - Keep pricing simple (3 tiers only)

---

### 10.2 Roadmap Prioritization

**Feature Requests to Accelerate:**
1. **Auto-sync via POS APIs** (Q3  ->  Q2 2025) - #1 user request
2. **WhatsApp notifications** (Q4  ->  Q2 2025) - High engagement potential

**Features to Delay:**
1. **Inventory tracking** (Q4  ->  2026) - Complex, out of scope for MVP
2. **Recipe costing** (Not planned  ->  2026) - Nice-to-have, not core
