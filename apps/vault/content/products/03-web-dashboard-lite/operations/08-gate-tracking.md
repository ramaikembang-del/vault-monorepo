## Decision Tree (Week 4 Friday)

### [x] GATE 1B PASSES (50+ Users, 30%+ Engagement, >50% D7 Retention)

**Actions:**
1. **Proceed to Paid Tier Launch** - Enable Starter (Rp 200K) + Pro (Rp 350K) tiers in Week 5
2. **Validate paid conversion** - Target: 5-10% of 50 users = 3-5 paid subscribers
3. **Scale acquisition** - Facebook ads, community posts (proven PMF)
4. **Content marketing** - Case study from early users

**Revenue Projection:**
- 50 users Ã— 10% paid = 5 paid subs
- 5 Ã— Rp 275K avg (mix of Starter/Pro) = Rp 1.375M MRR

**Next Gate:**
- Gate 2 (Sprint 2): 5%+ paid conversion, <15% churn

---

### [!] GATE 1B PARTIAL (30-49 Users OR 20-29% Engagement)

**Analysis Required:**
- **Low users?** Marketing channel issue (acquisition)
- **Low engagement?** Product/UX issue (onboarding, value delivery)

**Actions:**
1. **Extend 1 week** - Give Week 5 to hit 50 users OR 30% engagement
2. **Tactical fixes:**
 - If low users: Boost Facebook ads Rp 500K  ->  Rp 2M
 - If low engagement: Improve onboarding (add tutorial, simplify first use)
3. **Defer paid launch** - Don't enable paid tier until freemium proves value

**Re-evaluate:** Week 5 Friday

---

### [x] GATE 1B FAILS (<30 Users, <20% Engagement, <40% D7 Retention)

**Root Cause Analysis:**

| Possible Cause | Diagnostic | Fix |
|----------------|------------|-----|
| **Wrong market** | Low signups despite marketing | Pivot to Phase 2 (SME) instead of Phase 1 |
| **Product unclear** | High signups, low activation (CSV upload) | Simplify onboarding, add sample data |
| **Not valuable** | Good activation, low retention | Add more free metrics (6  ->  10) |
| **Technical issues** | Users report bugs/crashes | Fix critical bugs, re-launch Week 5 |

**Pivot Options:**
1. **Increase free metrics** - 6  ->  10 metrics (more value)
2. **Add email insights** - Daily email summary (engagement boost)
3. **Pivot to template** - Defer E1, focus on A1 template only
4. **Kill E1** - Focus resources on A1 + R1 + R2 accounting modules

**Decision:** Week 6 (2-week analysis)

**In-App NPS Survey (Week 4 Friday):**

| Rating | Count | % | User Quote |

| **7-8 (Passives)** | 22 | 44% | "Good but needs more features" |
| **0-6 (Detractors)** | 10 | 20% | "Too simple, already use Excel" |

**NPS Score:** (36% - 20%) = +16 (Target: >40 for PMF)
**Analysis:** Positive but not slam-dunk PMF. Need to convert passives  ->  promoters.
