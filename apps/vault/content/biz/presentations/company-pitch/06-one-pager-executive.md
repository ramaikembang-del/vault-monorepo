## The Challenge
**Revenue Gap:** IDR 8 Bn → 12 Bn target (**IDR 4 Bn gap**)
**Problem:** No daily visibility → Reactive management → Miss targets at month-end

## The Solution
**Real-Time Decision Dashboard** for Assistant Manager

**3 Tabs:**
1. **Command Center** - Revenue tracking (Gap to 12Bn, daily run rate, waterfall)
2. **Wolf Pack** - Staff gamification (20 staff, performance leaderboard, drill-through coaching)
3. **Loyalty Loop** - Customer retention (VIP tracking, NPS, patronage funnel)

**Innovation:** Three-tier approach
- **Operational Core (Build First):** ~25 metrics/tab for daily AM use
 - Tab 1 (15): Gap to 12Bn, Daily Run Rate, Today's Revenue, MTD %, Waterfall (5 buckets), Heatmap, plus 5 drill-through metrics
 - Tab 2 (14): Performance Score, Team Avg, Top Performer, Tier Badges, 2 Alerts, plus 8 drill-through metrics per staff
 - Tab 3 (18): Patronage Funnel (4 stages), NPS, Repeat Rate, Lapsed VIPs, Scatter, Word Cloud, plus 9 drill-through metrics
- **Comprehensive Catalog (Future):** ~150 total metrics documented and ready
 - Revenue (32): Forecast to 12Bn, YoY Growth %, category mix %, transaction analytics, growth/pacing indicators
 - Staff (51): Peer comparisons, coaching indicators, achievement milestones, team analytics
 - Customer (36): CLV, journey conversion, spend behavior, retention curves, sentiment scores
 - Operational (20): Efficiency, capacity, profitability, shift performance, quality tracking
- Scales from essentials to advanced analytics without rebuilding
