## Opening (1 minute)

**You:** "Hi everyone! You're the Assistant Manager - you manage 20 staff, run daily operations, and you're responsible for helping us hit that 12 billion rupiah target. Right now, you're doing all of this... kind of blind, right?"

**Them (AM):** "Yeah, I mean, I get the sales reports at the end of the month."

**You:** "Exactly. End of month. By then, it's too late to fix anything. What if you could see yesterday's performance first thing this morning? What if you knew exactly which staff members need coaching today, not next month? That's what we built."

---

## Q1: What will I actually see when I open this? (3 minutes)

**Them:** "Okay, show me."

**You:** "Open the dashboard - you'll see 3 tabs. Let's start with your morning routine."

### **Tab 1: Command Center**

**You (showing screen):** "7 AM, you grab your phone. You open Tab 1. Top of the screen, 4 big cards:"

1. **Gap to 12Bn** - "We're at 8.7 billion, we need 12 billion. Gap: 3.3 billion left to close."
2. **Required Daily Run Rate** - "To hit target, we need to make 35 million today."
3. **Today's Revenue** - "Live number. Right now it's 8 AM, we're at 2 million. We're slow."
4. **Month-to-Date vs Target** - "We're at 78% of target for the month. Green = good, red = behind."

**You:** "5 seconds. You know if you're on track or not."

**Them:** "What if I want to know *why* we're behind?"

**You:** "Scroll down. See this waterfall chart? It shows you exactly where revenue is coming from."

**You (pointing):** "See? Base sales are fine. Reservations are strong. But upsells are weak - only 2 million when we usually hit 4 million. And discounts are high - we gave away 3 million."

**Them:** "So I know to push my staff on upsells today and watch the discounts."

**You:** "Bingo. Actionable, not just informational."

---

## Q2: How do I know which staff to coach? (5 minutes)

**Them:** "Okay, revenue makes sense. But I have 20 people. How do I know who needs help?"

**You:** "Tab 2. The Wolf Pack. This is where it gets fun."

### **Tab 2: Staff Leaderboard**

**You (showing):** "Top of the screen - alerts. See this?"

- **3 staff late today**
- **2 unresolved complaints**

**You:** "You immediately know there's a problem. Click the late count - it shows you who: Joko, Ahmad, and Siti."

**Them:** "I talk to them when they arrive."

**You:** "Exactly. Now look at the leaderboard."

**You (pointing to leaderboard):**
```
#1 Rina Wati 92/100 Gold
#2 Budi Santoso 87/100 Silver
#3 Siti Aminah 85/100 Silver
...
#10 Joko Susilo 68/100 Bronze
```

**Them:** "So Rina's on top, Joko's at the bottom. But how is this score calculated? Just sales?"

**You:** "No! That's what makes it fair. It's 6 components:"

1. **Sales Per Hour (25%)** - "Normalized by shift. Lunch vs dinner isn't apples to apples."
2. **Upsell Count (20%)** - "Are they actually pushing desserts and drinks?"
3. **Avg Customer Rating (25%)** - "From feedback forms. Guest satisfaction."
4. **Tables Per Hour (15%)** - "Efficiency. How fast do they turn tables?"
5. **Discipline Score (10%)** - "NEW. This is huge."
6. **Week-over-Week Trend (5%)** - "Are they improving or declining?"

**Them:** "Wait, what's the Discipline Score?"

**You:** "Glad you asked. It's 5 things we track automatically:"

1. **Punctuality (25%)** - "Clock-in data. Were they on time?"
2. **No Early Outs (20%)** - "Did they leave their shift early?"
3. **Shift Completion (25%)** - "Did they show up for all scheduled shifts?"
4. **Order Accuracy (15%)** - "How many orders did they void? Voids = mistakes."
5. **Conflict Resolution (15%)** - "When a customer complains, did they resolve it?"

**Them:** "This is all automatic?"

**You:** "Completely. Pulled from the time clock, the POS, and customer feedback. No manual entry."

---

## Q3: What if I need more detail on someone? (3 minutes)

**Them:** "Okay, let's say Joko is at #10. How do I figure out why?"

**You:** "Click his name."

**You (showing drill-through):** "You get his personal card. 8 metrics:"

1. **Gap to Target** - "His monthly goal is 15 million. He's at 11 million. He needs 4 million more."
2. **Gap to Bonus** - "Bonus kicks in at 12 million. He's 1 million short."
3. **Upsell Count** - "He's only done 12 upsells this month. Team average is 25."
4. **Service Speed** - "His average table time is 32 minutes. Team average is 24 minutes."
5. **Positive Mentions** - "He's only gotten 2 customer compliments. Rina has 15."
6. **Late Count** - "He's been late 5 times this month."
7. **Discipline Breakdown** - "Radar chart showing all 5 components."
8. **Rank Position** - "#10 of 20"

**Them:** "So I can see he's slow, he doesn't upsell, and he's late a lot."

**You:** "Yep. Now you have a coaching conversation based on data, not guesses. 'Joko, I see you're 1 million from bonus. Let's work on your service speed and upsells.'"

## Q4: What about customers? (3 minutes)

**Them:** "This is great for staff. What about customers?"

**You:** "Tab 3. Loyalty Loop."

### **Tab 3: Customer Tracking**

**You (showing):** "Top cards:"
- **NPS Score: +45** - "Green. We're doing well."
- **Repeat Rate: 65%** - "2 out of 3 customers come back."
- **Lapsed VIPs: 12** - "12 VIP customers haven't been here in 60+ days."

**Them:** "I should call those 12 VIPs."

**You:** "Exactly! Click the number - it gives you their names and phone numbers. Personal outreach."

**You (showing funnel):** "This funnel shows your customer pipeline:"
- **First Timers (40%)** - "1,200 people tried us once."
- **Returning (30%)** - "900 came back for a 2nd or 3rd visit."
- **Regular (20%)** - "600 are regulars."
- **VIP (10%)** - "300 are VIPs (10+ visits)."

**Them:** "So I can see if first-timers are converting?"

**You:** "Yes! If that funnel narrows too much at the top, you know your first impression isn't great."

**You (showing word cloud):** "And this word cloud shows what customers are saying:"

```
 DELICIOUS service
 friendly SLOW great
ATMOSPHERE food
```

**Them:** "Oh no, SLOW is big."

**You:** "Yep. Time to address service speed. Maybe that's why Joko's numbers are down - customers are complaining about speed."

## Q5: Can I use this on my phone? (2 minutes)

**Them:** "I'm not at a desk all day. Can I check this on my phone?"

**You (switching to mobile):** "Absolutely. Here's the mobile version - we call it 'Floor Mode.'"

**You (showing phone):**
```
Daily Progress: 80%
IDR 32M / IDR 40M

Top 5 Staff:
#1 Rina 92
#2 Budi 87
#3 Siti 85

Tonight's Bookings: 18 tables
Lapsed VIPs: 12
```

**Them:** "Perfect. I can check between lunch and dinner."

**You:** "Exactly. Vertical scroll, big cards, no tables. Quick glance."

---

## Q6: How often should I check this? (2 minutes)

**Them:** "This is a lot of information. Do I need to look at this every hour?"

**You:** "No! Here's the workflow:"

**Morning (5 minutes):**
- Tab 1: Did we hit yesterday's target?
- Tab 2: Who was late? Who's underperforming?
- Tab 3: How many lapsed VIPs?

**During shift:**
- Quick glance: Are we on pace for today's run rate?

**End of day (10 minutes):**
- Tab 1: Did we hit today's target?
- Tab 2: Click bottom 3 performers → prep coaching notes
- Tab 3: Check NPS - any new feedback?

**Weekly meeting (30 minutes):**
- Deep dive trends
- Team discussion

**Them:** "So it's not another full-time job."

**You:** "Exactly. 5 minutes in the morning, 10 at night, 30 minutes weekly. That's it."

---

## Q7: What if I want a metric you don't have? (1 minute)

**Them:** "What if I think of something else I need?"

**You:** "Tell the product team. We've actually documented ~150 possible metrics - this dashboard only shows ~50 total, the most important ones. If you say 'can we add X?', we probably already planned for it. It's in the catalog."

**Them:** "Will it cost more?"

**You:** "Usually no. The data structure already supports it. Adding a new visual is hours, not weeks."

---

## Closing: Next Steps (1 minute)

**You:** "So what do you think?"

**Them:** "I like it. When can I start using it?"

**You:** "We're in testing now. Next week, you'll get hands-on training - 2 hours, you and me, going through real scenarios. Then Week 3, you'll train your 20 staff - 30 minutes, show them how to see their own performance card."

**You:** "By Week 5, it's yours. Daily use. And I'll check in weekly for the first month to see what's working and what's confusing."

**Them:** "Can I suggest changes?"

**You:** "Please! This is your tool. We'll have a feedback loop. If something's not useful, we fix it. If you ask for something from the backlog, we add it."

## Common Questions

**Q: "Will my staff see each other's scores?"**
A: "The leaderboard shows everyone. Transparency. But the drill-through - the detailed 8 metrics - is their private card. Only you see all 20 cards."

**Q: "What if a staff member complains the score is unfair?"**
A: "Show them the breakdown. 'You're low on upsells - 12 vs team average of 25. You've been late 5 times. These are facts from the system, not my opinion.'"

**Q: "Can I export this to Excel?"**
A: "You can, but why? The live dashboard is always up-to-date. Excel would be a snapshot."

**Q: "How do I know the data is accurate?"**
A: "It comes from the same POS and time clock you already use. We're just organizing it better."
