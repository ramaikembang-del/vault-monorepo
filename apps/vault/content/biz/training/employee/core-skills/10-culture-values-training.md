## Our Mission

**Help Indonesian F&B businesses make data-driven decisions to grow profitably.**

Every decision we make should ladder up to this mission.

---

## Our Values

### 1. Customer Obsession

**What it means:**
- Customers are why we exist
- Every decision starts with "how does this help customers?"
- We talk to customers constantly (not just CS team!)

**In practice:**
- Talk to 1 customer per week (everyone, including engineers!)
- Read customer feedback weekly
- Join customer calls when possible
- Think: "Would I recommend this to my friend who owns a restaurant?"

**Not:**
- Building features nobody wants
- Ignoring customer feedback
- Saying "not my job" to customer problems

---

### 2. Bias for Action

**What it means:**
- Move fast, iterate, learn
- Done is better than perfect
- Two-way door decisions → decide quickly

**In practice:**
- Ship MVPs, get feedback, improve
- Make decisions with 70% information (don't wait for 100%)
- Prototype before building fully
- Fail fast, learn fast

**Not:**
- Analysis paralysis
- Waiting for perfect solution
- "Let's have another meeting to decide"

---

### 3. Transparency

**What it means:**
- Share information openly
- Document decisions (in writing)
- Overcommunicate
- Radically honest feedback

**In practice:**
- Default to public Slack channels (not DMs)
- Share context when making decisions
- Ask "why" freely
- Give and receive feedback directly

**Not:**
- Hidden agendas
- Behind-closed-doors decisions
- "You don't need to know"

---

### 4. Ownership

**What it means:**
- Own outcomes, not just tasks
- See problem, fix problem (or flag it)
- No "that's not my job"

**In practice:**
- Take initiative
- Follow through on commits
- Help teammates (even if not your area)
- Disagree and commit (voice opinion, then support decision)

**Not:**
- "Not my responsibility"
- Blaming others
- Waiting to be told what to do

---

### 5. Indonesian F&B Focus

**What it means:**
- Deep understanding of local market
- Build for Indonesian context
- Pricing, compliance, language

**In practice:**
- Study Indonesian F&B regulations
- Pricing in Rupiah, interfaces in Indonesian
- Understand local payment methods
- Comply with PDPN, tax laws
- Visit local restaurants, understand their challenges

---

## How We Work

### Communication Norms

**Slack:**
- Use public channels (transparency)
- Threads keep conversations organized
- React with emoji (saves typing)
- @mention for urgency
- Assume positive intent

**Meetings:**
- Have agenda or cancel
- Start/end on time
- Take notes, share action items
- Camera on for important meetings
- No laptops (unless presenting)

**Decisions:**
- Document in writing
- Share widely
- Explain "why"
- Two-way doors = fast, one-way doors = slow

---

### Feedback Culture

**We give feedback because we care.**

**How to Give Feedback:**
- Timely (within 24 hours)
- Specific (not "you're doing great", but "your demo was excellent because...")
- Direct (kind, but honest)
- Actionable (" next time, try...")

**How to Receive Feedback:**
- Listen (don't interrupt)
- Ask clarifying questions
- Thank them (even if you disagree)
- Reflect and decide what to act on

---

### Work-Life Balance

**We work hard AND sustainably.**

**Flexible Hours:**
- Core hours: 10 AM - 4 PM WIB (be available)

**Spot Bonuses:** Manager discretion for exceptional work

---

## Questions to Reflect

**Customer Obsession:**
- When did you last talk to a customer?
- How does your current project help customers?

**Bias for Action:**
- What decision are you delaying that you could make today?

**Transparency:**
- Is there information you're holding that should be shared?

**Ownership:**
- What problem have you noticed that you could help fix?

**Indonesian F&B Focus:**
- Do you understand our customers' daily challenges?

---

## Living Our Values

**Values aren't posters on the wall. They're how we work every day.**

**You'll see values in action when:**
- Engineer joins customer call to understand problem
- PM ships MVP in 1 week instead of "perfect" in 3 months
- Team debates decision openly in Slack, then commits
- Someone from sales helps fix a bug (even though "not my job")
- We turn down feature request because it doesn't serve Indonesian F&B

---

**Our culture is what we do, not what we say. Let's build it together.** **Questions?** Ask your manager or #culture Slack
