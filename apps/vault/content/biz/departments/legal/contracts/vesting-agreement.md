## Founder Vesting (Recommended)

**Why Founders Should Vest:**
- Protects co-founders (if one leaves early, others get their equity)
- Investor requirement (VCs won't invest without founder vesting)
- Fairness (earn equity by building, not just starting)

**Typical Founder Vesting:**
- 4-year vest, 1-year cliff
- OR: Reverse vesting (start with 100%, company buys back unvested if you leave)

**Founder Credit:**
- Credit for time already worked (e.g., "6 months credit" = 12.5% vested on Day 1)

---

## Employee Equity Guidelines

**Early Employees (1-5):**  
0.5-2% equity each

**Later Employees (6-20):**  
0.1-0.5% equity each

**Advisors:**  
0.25-1% equity (for 2-year advisory period)

**Adjustments:**
- Senior roles get more
- Critical hires get more
- Later hires get less (company is less risky)
