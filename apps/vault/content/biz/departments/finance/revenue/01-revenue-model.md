## Revenue by Strategic Pillar (Year 5)

| Pillar | Products Contributing | ARR Contribution | % of Total |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|------------|
| **Acquisition** | A1, A2, A3 (if secured), A4a-e | Rp 2.5B | 33% |

| **Defense** | D1-D4 (premium features) | Rp 500M | 7% |

**Consolidated ARR:** Rp 7.56B (accounts for cannibalization in bundles)

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Best Case: All Gates Pass Early

-Assumptions: Every gate passes on first try, low churn, high conversion

**Year 1:** Rp 180M ARR (+50%)
**Year 3:** Rp 3.5B ARR (+50%)
**Year 5:** Rp 11B ARR (+45%)

---

### Base Case: 70% Gate Success Rate

**Assumptions:** 2-3 gates require iteration, industry-standard churn (15-20%)

**Year 1:** Rp 120M ARR (as planned)
**Year 3:** Rp 2.34B ARR (as planned)
**Year 5:** Rp 7.56B ARR (as planned)

---

### Worst Case: Only Sprint 1 Succeeds

**Assumptions:** Gates 2-3 fail, pivot to template+support only

**Year 1:** Rp 40M ARR (templates + support only)
**Year 3:** Rp 120M ARR (consultancy model, high-margin but capped)
**Year 5:** Rp 200M ARR (manual-heavy, no SaaS scale)

**Exit Strategy:** Pivot to SaaS in Year 2 with external funding OR sell consultancy business

---

## Cash Flow Timing

**When Do We Collect Payment?**

**Templates (A1):**
- Payment: Upfront (within 7 days of purchase)
- Cash collected: Month of sale

**Subscriptions (All MRR products):**
- Payment: Monthly advance (1st of month)
- First payment: Signup month + 1 (unless mid-month, then prorated)
- Churn impact: Lost revenue hits same month as churn

**Accounting Implications:**
- **Accrual:** Recognize subscription revenue monthly over service period
- **Cash:** Collect upfront (better for cash flow)
- **Deferred Revenue:** 0 (monthly billing, no annual pre-payment yet)

---

## Revenue Tracking Dashboard (KPIs)

**Daily:**
- Template sales count + GMV
- Lite freemium signups
- Paid conversion events

**Weekly:**
- MRR growth (new + expansion - churn)
- New paying customers
- Free → paid conversion rate

**Monthly:**
- ARR (MRR × 12)

## Next Steps
