## Team Growth & Hiring Timeline

### Month 9-10: First Hire - Customer Success Manager

**Trigger:** Approaching breakeven, PMF validated, need to scale customer success

**Gate:**
- MRR > Rp 80-100M (end of Month 9)
- 50+ active customers (too much for 2-person team)
- Clear PMF signal (validated retention, upsell patterns)

**Role:**
- Handle customer onboarding (20+ new customers/month is too much for 2-person team)
- Manage support tickets (WhatsApp, email)
- Drive upsells (identify customers ready for tier upgrades)
- Customer success metrics (NPS, retention)

**Salary:** Rp 8-10M/month (mid-level, Indonesian market rate)

**Impact:**
- Founding team time freed: 20 hours/week → focus on product + sales
- Customer satisfaction improves: Professional onboarding, faster support
- Upsell revenue: +Rp 2-3M MRR from proactive account management

---

### Month 18: Second Hire - Marketing/Content Specialist

**Trigger:** MRR > Rp 80M, need scalable customer acquisition

**Role:**
- SEO content creation (blog, guides, case studies)
- Social media management (LinkedIn, Instagram for F&B)
- Email marketing campaigns
- Community management (F&B associations, online forums)

**Salary:** Rp 6-7M/month (content specialist)

**Impact:**
- Organic traffic: 2-3× growth (more content = more inbound leads)
- CAC reduction: 30% (organic vs. paid ads)
- Brand authority: Thought leadership content

---

### Year 3: Grow to 5-Person Team

**New Hires:**
1. **Sales Rep** (Rp 10M/month + 10% commission)
 - Outbound sales (target C2-C4 enterprise customers)
 - Demo calls (founding team can't handle 50+ demos/month)
 - Pipeline management

2. **Developer** (Rp 12-15M/month)
 - IF technical debt > AI-coding capability
 - Custom enterprise features (C4 requires dedicated dev)
 - Integration maintenance (POS partnerships growing)

**Team Structure Year 3:**
- Founding Team: CEO/Product
- CSM: Customer success
- Marketing: Content + community
- Sales: B2B outbound
- Dev: Engineering support

---

### Year 5: Grow to 15-Person Team

**Departments:**
- **Product/Engineering (5):** 1 PM + 4 devs
- **Sales & Marketing (5):** 1 sales manager + 2 sales reps + 2 marketing
- **Customer Success (3):** 1 CSM manager + 2 CSMs
- **Operations (2):** Finance + HR/ops

**Payroll:** Rp 150M/month = Rp 1.8B/year

---

## Capital Requirements & Funding Strategy

### Bootstrap Path (Recommended Year 1)

**Why Bootstrap:**
- Profitable Month 1 (Rp 38.6M Q1 revenue - Rp 19.6M expenses = +Rp 19M)
- No dilution (founding team keeps 100% equity)
- Forces discipline (can't over-hire or overspend)

**Runway:** Infinite (profitable from start)

**Risk:** Slower growth (can't invest aggressively in marketing until revenue permits)

---

### Fundraising Option (If Desired)

**If Founding Team Prefers Faster Growth:**

**Seed Round (Month 6-12):**
- Raise: Rp 1-2B
- Valuation: Rp 5-10B post-money (based on Rp 120M ARR × 5-10× SaaS multiple)
- Dilution: 20-25%
- Use of funds:
 - Rp 500M: Aggressive marketing (2× customer growth)
 - Rp 400M: Hiring (bring on team 12 months earlier)
 - Rp 300M: Product development (build C3-C4 faster)
 - Rp 300-800M: Runway/buffer

**Impact:**
- Year 2 ARR: Rp 2.5B (vs. Rp 1.44B bootstrapped) = +73%
- Year 3 customers: 400 (vs. 250 bootstrapped) = +60%
- Trade-off: 25% equity dilution, external accountability (board, investors)

**Recommendation:** Bootstrap Year 1, THEN evaluate funding in Year 2 if:
- Gates all pass (product clearly works)
- Competitive threat emerges (need to move faster)
- International expansion opportunity (SEA market)

---

## Financial Risk & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Burn Rate Exceeds Revenue (Year 1)

**Scenario:** Revenue misses targets, expenses stay fixed

**Likelihood:** LOW (profitable Month 1, conservative forecast)

**Mitigation:**
- Variable costs only (marketing scales with revenue)
- Defer hiring if MRR triggers not hit
- Founding team takes minimal salary (can sustain with 2-person split)

---

### Risk 2: Churn Kills MRR Growth

**Scenario:** Customers churn faster than we acquire new ones

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (SME SaaS 15-20% annual churn is normal)

**Mitigation:**
- Customer success focus (hire CSM Month 12)
- Usage monitoring (proactive intervention before churn)
- Annual contracts (lock in 12 months, reduces monthly churn impact)
- Product stickiness (accounting data lock-in, hard to switch)

---

### Risk 3: POS Partnerships Fail → A3 Blocked

**Scenario:** All POS companies decline partnership

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (competitive landscape, they may build in-house)

**Mitigation:**
- Build direct integrations anyway (no official partnership needed for C1-C4)
- Deprioritize A3 to Year 2 (focus C1-C4 = higher value)
- Partnership isn't required for core business (just accelerant)

**Impact if A3 Blocked:** Rp 2B ARR reduction (Year 5: Rp 7.56B → Rp 5.5B) — still very successful

---

## Break-Even Analysis

**Break-Even Point:** Month 1

**Why So Fast:**
- High gross margins (87%)
- Low fixed costs (2-person founding team, minimal payroll)
- Templates provide upfront cash (no waiting for MRR buildup)

**Unit Economics Break-Even:**
- Revenue per customer (avg): Rp 115K/month
- Variable cost per customer: Rp 15K/month (13% COGS)
- Contribution margin: Rp 100K/customer/month

**Fixed Costs (Month 1):**
- Tools: Rp 750K
- Marketing: Rp 3M
- Total: Rp 3.75M/month

**Break-even customers:** 3.75M ÷ Rp 100K = **38 customers**

We hit 38 paying customers by Month 2 (Sprint 1 Week 4)

## Profitability Milestones

| Milestone | Timeline | Metric |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **First profitable month** | Month 1 | +Rp 19M net profit |
| **Rp 10M MRR** | Month 12 | Rp 120M ARR exit |
| **Hire first employee** | Month 12 | CSM @ Rp 8M/month |
| **Rp 100M MRR** | Month 24 | Rp 1.2B ARR |
| **First Rp 1B profit year** | Year 3 | Rp 1.05B net profit |
| **Rp 500M MRR** | Month 48 | Rp 6B ARR |

---

## Valuation Trajectory

**SaaS Valuation Methodology:** Revenue multiples (ARR × Multiple)

| Year | ARR | Multiple | Valuation | Rationale for Multiple |
|------|-----|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | Rp 120M | 3-5× | **Rp 360M-600M** | Early-stage, unproven retention |
| 2 | Rp 1.44B | 5-7× | **Rp 7.2-10B** | Proven model, strong growth |
| 3 | Rp 2.34B | 5-8× | **Rp 11.7-18.7B** | Market leader emerging |
| 5 | Rp 7.56B | 4-6× | **Rp 30-45B** | Mature SaaS, lower growth rate |

**Exit Opportunity Window:** Year 3-5 (Rp 12-45B valuation range)

**Comparable Exits:**
- Moka (POS) raised at ~$100M valuation = Rp 1.5T (2020)
- Indonesian SaaS exits typically 4-8× ARR depending on growth rate
