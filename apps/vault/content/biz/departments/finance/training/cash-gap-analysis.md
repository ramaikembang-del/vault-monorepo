## Exercise Overview

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Identify when cash gaps occur (timing mismatch between inflows and outflows)
2. Calculate gap size (how much short?)
3. Design solutions (financing, operational changes)

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate

## Scenario

**Company:** F&B restaurant (20 tables, 100 covers/day)  
**Problem:** Seasonal cash crunch every January (slow month post-holidays)

**Cash Flow Pattern:**

| Month | Revenue | Expenses | Net Cash Flow |
|-------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Nov | Rp 300M | Rp 250M | +Rp 50M |
| Dec | Rp 400M | Rp 280M | +Rp 120M |
| **Jan** | **Rp 150M** | **Rp 250M** | **-Rp 100M** (GAP!) |
| Feb | Rp 250M | Rp 250M | Rp 0 |
| Mar | Rp 300M | Rp 250M | +Rp 50M |

**Current Cash Balance (Jan 1):** Rp 80M

## Task 1: Identify the Gap

**Questions:**
1. Will the restaurant run out of cash in January?
2. If yes, on what date approximately? (Assume even daily burn)
3. What is the total shortfall amount?

**Calculation:**
- Cash needed in Jan: Rp 250M (expenses)
- Cash available: Rp 80M (starting) + Rp 150M (Jan revenue) = Rp 230M
- Shortfall: Rp 250M - Rp 230M = **Rp 20M gap**

---

## Task 2: Root Cause Analysis

**Why does the gap exist?**

**Potential Causes:**
- [ ] Seasonal demand drop (January is slow month - people recovering from holiday spending)
- [ ] Fixed expenses (rent, salaries don't decrease with revenue)
- [ ] Timing (revenue collected daily, but expenses paid monthly - landlord wants full rent on Jan 5)
- [ ] Previous months' over-spending (December bonuses paid in January)

**Which causes apply to this scenario? (Check all that apply)**

## Task 3: Solution Design

**How to bridge the Rp 20M gap?**

**Option A: Short-Term Financing**
- Bank overdraft (Rp 20M, 15% annual interest, repay in Feb)
- Cost: Rp 250K interest expense
- Pros: Quick, preserves cash
- Cons: Interest cost, requires bank relationship

**Option B: Accelerate Revenue**
- "January Special" promotion (20% off to drive traffic)
- Target: Increase Jan revenue from Rp 150M → Rp 180M (+Rp 30M)
- Cost: Rp 36M in discounts (20% of Rp 180M)
- Net: Rp 30M revenue - Rp 36M discounts = -Rp 6M (doesn't work!)

**Option C: Reduce Expenses**
- Cut January expenses from Rp 250M → Rp 230M (-Rp 20M)
- Options: Reduce marketing, defer equipment maintenance, ask suppliers for 30-day payment terms
- Pros: No financing cost
- Cons: May hurt long-term (deferred maintenance = bigger problems later)

**Option D: Owner Cash Injection**
- Owner lends Rp 20M to business (interest-free, repay in March)
- Pros: No external financing, flexible terms
- Cons: Owner must have personal cash available

**Which option would you choose? Why?**

## Task 4: Prevention Strategy

**How to avoid this gap next year?**

**Strategies:**
1. **Build Cash Reserve:**
   - Save Rp 10M extra in Nov-Dec (from good months)
   - Target: Rp 100M starting cash by Jan 1 (instead of Rp 80M)

2. **Smooth Expenses:**
   - Negotiate with landlord: Pay rent in 2 installments (Jan 5 + Jan 20)
   - Spread out bonuses (pay 50% in Dec, 50% in Feb)

3. **Boost January Revenue:**
   - "New Year Promo" (but profitable - 10% off, not 20%)
   - Corporate catering (many companies have Jan events)
   - Delivery partnerships (Gojek, Grab promotions)

4. **Line of Credit:**
   - Arrange Rp 50M credit line in November (before you need it)
   - Only draw down if gap occurs

**Write a 1-paragraph prevention plan for next year.**

## Answer Key (Example)

**Task 1:**
- Yes, will run short by Rp 20M
- Approximately January 24-25 (assuming even burn of Rp 8M/day)
- Total shortfall: Rp 20M

**Task 2:**
- ✅ Seasonal demand drop (primary cause)
- ✅ Fixed expenses (rent, salaries don't flex)
- ✅ Timing mismatch (rent due Jan 5, revenue comes daily)

**Task 3: Recommended Solution**
- **Option D** (Owner cash injection) for this year
- **Reason:** Cheapest (no interest), flexible, quick
- **Backup:** Arrange Option A (bank overdraft) as fallback if owner can't inject

**Task 4: Prevention Plan**
> "Build Rp 50M cash reserve by saving Rp 10M extra in Nov-Dec. Negotiate with landlord to split January rent into 2 payments (Rp 50M on Jan 5, Rp 50M on Jan 20). Launch 'New Year Menu' promotion (10% off, profitable volume increase). Arrange Rp 50M credit line in November as safety buffer."

## Learning Takeaways

**Key Lessons:**

1. **Cash Gaps ≠ Unprofitable Business:**
   - Restaurant is overall profitable (most months positive cash flow)
   - Gap is timing issue, not structural problem

2. **Seasonal Businesses Need Buffers:**
   - Save in good months, spend in bad months
   - Rule of thumb: 3 months expenses in cash reserve

3. **Prevention > Reaction:**
   - Easier to prevent gaps (save ahead) than fix them (expensive financing)

4. **Multiple Solutions Exist:**
   - Financing, revenue acceleration, expense reduction, owner injection
   - Often best to combine (save + line of credit + modest promotion)
