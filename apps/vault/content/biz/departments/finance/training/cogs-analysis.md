## Exercise Overview

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Calculate COGS accurately
2. Analyze COGS % (cost as % of revenue)
3. Identify opportunities to improve margins

**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Prerequisites:** Basic math, understanding of revenue and costs

---

## What is COGS?

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**  
Direct costs to produce the product you sell

**For F&B:**
- Raw materials (food ingredients, beverages)
- Packaging (takeaway containers, cups, napkins)
- Direct labor (chefs, cooks - sometimes included)

**NOT included in COGS:**
- Rent (operating expense)
- Marketing (operating expense)
- Admin salaries (operating expense)

**Formula:**
```
Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
Gross Margin % = (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100
```

**Target for F&B:** COGS should be 30-40% of revenue (60-70% gross margin)

## Scenario: Warung Makan "Sari Rasa"

**Monthly Performance:**
- Revenue: Rp 50M
- Transactions: 2,500 (avg Rp 20K per transaction)
- Operating 26 days/month

**Menu (Top 5 items, 80% of sales):**

| Item | Price | COGS per Unit | Units Sold | Revenue | COGS Total |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|---------|------------|
| Nasi Goreng | Rp 25K | Rp 8K | 600 | Rp 15M | ? |
| Ayam Geprek | Rp 30K | Rp 12K | 500 | Rp 15M | ? |
| Es Teh Manis | Rp 5K | Rp 1K | 800 | Rp 4M | ? |
| Soto Ayam | Rp 20K | Rp 7K | 400 | Rp 8M | ? |
| Bakso | Rp 18K | Rp 6K | 200 | Rp 3.6M | ? |

**Other items:** Rp 4.4M revenue, assume 35% COGS

---

## Task 1: Calculate COGS

**Complete the table:**

1. Calculate COGS Total for each item (COGS per Unit × Units Sold)
2. Sum total COGS for all items
3. Calculate COGS % (Total COGS / Total Revenue)

**Questions:**
- What is the total COGS for the month?
- What is the COGS %?
- Is this healthy for an F&B business? (Compare to 30-40% target)

---

## Task 2: Item-Level Analysis

**For each menu item, calculate:**
- Gross profit per unit: Price - COGS per Unit
- Gross margin %: (Gross Profit / Price) × 100

**Complete this table:**

| Item | Price | COGS | Gross Profit | Gross Margin % |
|------|-------|------|--------------|----------------|
| Nasi Goreng | Rp 25K | Rp 8K | ? | ? |
| Ayam Geprek | Rp 30K | Rp 12K | ? | ? |
| Es Teh Manis | Rp 5K | Rp 1K | ? | ? |
| Soto Ayam | Rp 20K | Rp 7K | ? | ? |
| Bakso | Rp 18K | Rp 6K | ? | ? |

**Questions:**
1. Which item has the highest gross margin %?
2. Which item has the lowest gross margin %?
3. Which item contributes most to total gross profit (Gross Profit × Units Sold)?

---

## Task 3: Menu Optimization

**Based on your analysis, what actions would you take?**

**Scenario A: Ayam Geprek has low margin (40%) but high sales**

**Options:**
- [ ] Increase price (Rp 30K → Rp 32K, +7% price)
- [ ] Reduce COGS (negotiate with chicken supplier, reduce portion size)
- [ ] Keep as is (it's a traffic driver, customers come for Ayam Geprek)
- [ ] Discontinue (low margin dragging down overall profitability)

**Scenario B: Es Teh Manis has high margin (80%) but low revenue impact**

**Options:**
- [ ] Promote heavily (upsell with every meal)
- [ ] Bundle (combo deal: Nasi Goreng + Es Teh = Rp 28K, margin boost)
- [ ] Keep as is (already popular, 800 units sold)

**Write 2-3 specific actions you'd take to improve overall COGS %.**

---

## Task 4: Supplier Negotiation

**Current supplier costs:**
- Rice: Rp 15K/kg (Nasi Goreng uses 200g = Rp 3K per serving)
- Chicken: Rp 40K/kg (Ayam Geprek uses 250g = Rp 10K per serving)

**New supplier offers 10% discount (but requires Rp 5M prepayment):**

**Calculate:**
1. Monthly savings if you switch suppliers
2. ROI: How many months to break even on Rp 5M prepayment?
3. Would you switch? Why or why not?

---

## Answer Key (Example)

**Task 1:** 

Total COGS:
- Nasi Goreng: Rp 8K × 600 = Rp 4.8M
- Ayam Geprek: Rp 12K × 500 = Rp 6M
- Es Teh: Rp 1K × 800 = Rp 800K
- Soto: Rp 7K × 400 = Rp 2.8M
- Bakso: Rp 6K × 200 = Rp 1.2M
- Other: Rp 4.4M × 35% = Rp 1.54M
- **Total COGS: Rp 17.14M**

COGS %: Rp 17.14M / Rp 50M = **34.3%**

Assessment: **Healthy!** Within 30-40% target range.

---

**Task 2:**

| Item | Gross Profit | Gross Margin % |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Nasi Goreng | Rp 17K | 68% ✅ |
| Ayam Geprek | Rp 18K | 60% ⚠️ |
| Es Teh | Rp 4K | 80% ⭐ |
| Soto | Rp 13K | 65% ✅ |
| Bakso | Rp 12K | 67% ✅ |

**Highest margin:** Es Teh (80%)  
**Lowest margin:** Ayam Geprek (60%)  
**Biggest profit contributor:** Ayam Geprek (Rp 18K × 500 = Rp 9M)

---

**Task 3: Recommendations**

1. **Keep Ayam Geprek:** High volume compensates for lower margin, it's a signature dish
2. **Upsell Es Teh:** High margin, push "combo deals" to increase attachment rate from 800 → 1,200 units
3. **Negotiate chicken price:** 5-10% reduction in chicken cost would boost Ayam Geprek margin to 65%+

**Overall Impact:** Could reduce COGS % from 34.3% → 32% (Rp 1M+ extra profit/month)

---

**Task 4: Supplier Switch**

**Savings:**
- Rice: Rp 3K per serving × 10% = Rp 300 savings × 600 servings = Rp 180K/month
- Chicken: Rp 10K per serving × 10% = Rp 1K savings × 500 servings = Rp 500K/month
- **Total: Rp 680K/month savings**

**ROI:** Rp 5M / Rp 680K = 7.4 months to break even

**Decision:** **Yes, switch** (if supplier is reliable). Payback in <8 months, long-term savings significant.

## Learning Takeaways

**Key Lessons:**

1. **Not All Items Equal:**
   - Some have high margins (drinks), some low (proteins)
   - Mix matters (overall COGS % is weighted average)

2. **Volume vs Margin:**
   - Low-margin items can still be profitable (if high volume)
   - High-margin items need volume to impact bottom line

3. **Small Changes, Big Impact:**
   - 1-2% COGS reduction can mean Rp 500K-1M extra profit/month
   - Focus on high volume items first (80/20 rule)

4. **Data-Driven Menu Engineering:**
   - Track COGS % per item
   - Promote high-margin items
   - Optimize or remove low-performers
