## Exercise Overview

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Forecast cash inflows and outflows
2. Identify cash gaps (when you'll run out of money)
3. Plan financing needs (how much to raise, when)

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Basic accounting knowledge (revenue, expenses, cash flow)

---

## Scenario

**Company:** Your F&B startup (launched 3 months ago)  
**Product:** Power BI Template (one-time sales) + Support subscription  
**Current Cash:** Rp 50M

**Revenue Assumptions:**
- Template sales: 10 per month @ Rp 4.5M = Rp 45M/month
- Support subscriptions: Growing from 5 (Month 4) to 30 (Month 12) @ Rp 75K/month

**Expense Assumptions:**
- Personnel: Rp 15M/month (2 founders, sweat equity but need living expenses)
- Operations: Rp 3M/month (hosting, tools, marketing)
- One-time: Rp 10M (Month 6 - hire contractor for SaaS development)

---

## Task 1: Build Cash Flow Forecast (6 Months)

**Complete this table:**

| Month | Revenue | Expenses | Net Cash Flow | Ending Cash Balance |
|-------|---------|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Month 4 | Rp 45M + Rp 375K = Rp 45.4M | Rp 18M | ? | ? |
| Month 5 | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Month 6 | ? | ? (includes Rp 10M one-time) | ? | ? |
| Month 7 | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Month 8 | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Month 9 | ? | ? | ? | ? |

**Hints:**
- Net Cash Flow = Revenue - Expenses
- Ending Cash Balance = Previous Month's Ending Cash + Net Cash Flow
- Support MRR grows by 5 subscriptions/month (Rp 375K incremental)

---

## Task 2: Identify Cash Gap

**Questions:**
1. In which month (if any) do you run out of cash?
2. What is the minimum cash balance over the 6-month period?
3. How much additional funding (if any) do you need to survive 6 months?

---

## Task 3: Scenario Planning

**What if scenarios:**

**Optimistic Case:**
- Template sales increase to 15/month (instead of 10)
- Support conversion improves to 7 subscriptions/month (instead of 5)

**Pessimistic Case:**
- Template sales drop to 5/month
- Support conversion slows to 3 subscriptions/month
- Unexpected expense: Rp 15M (Months 5 - legal fees for contract dispute)

**Re-forecast cash flow for both scenarios. How does it change your financing needs?**

---

## Task 4: Cash Management Strategies

**Based on your forecast, what actions would you take?**

**Options:**
- [ ] Raise external funding (how much? when?)
- [ ] Cut expenses (what to cut?)
- [ ] Accelerate revenue (how? paid ads? partnerships?)
- [ ] Delay hires (push SaaS development to Month 9 instead of Month 6)
- [ ] Negotiate payment terms (prepayment discounts for customers?)

**Write a 1-paragraph cash management plan.**

## Answer Key (Example)

**Task 1: Completed Table**

| Month | Revenue | Expenses | Net Cash Flow | Ending Cash |
|-------|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Month 4 | Rp 45.4M | Rp 18M | +Rp 27.4M | Rp 77.4M |
| Month 5 | Rp 45.8M | Rp 18M | +Rp 27.8M | Rp 105.2M |
| Month 6 | Rp 46.1M | Rp 28M | +Rp 18.1M | Rp 123.3M |
| Month 7 | Rp 46.5M | Rp 18M | +Rp 28.5M | Rp 151.8M |
| Month 8 | Rp 46.9M | Rp 18M | +Rp 28.9M | Rp 180.7M |
| Month 9 | Rp 47.3M | Rp 18M | +Rp 29.3M | Rp 210M |

**Task 2: Analysis**
- No cash gap! Cash grows from Rp 50M → Rp 210M
- Minimum balance: Rp 77.4M (Month 4)
- No additional funding needed (profitable from Month 1)

**Task 3: Pessimistic Case**
- Cash would drop to ~Rp 20M by Month 9 (including unexpected legal fees)
- Recommendation: Raise Rp 50M buffer in Month 6 to be safe

**Task 4: Strategy**
- No immediate financing needed (base case)
- Consider raising Rp 100M in Month 6-9 to fund SaaS development + marketing scale
- Alternative: Bootstrap longer, delay SaaS to Year 2

## Learning Takeaways

**Key Lessons:**
1. **Cash ≠ Profit:** You can be profitable but run out of cash (timing mismatch)
2. **Forecast is a Range:** Always model best/base/worst cases
3. **Raise Before You Need:** Don't wait until Month 9 to raise (takes 3-6 months)
4. **Cash Burn Rate:** Know your monthly burn (how long your runway is)
