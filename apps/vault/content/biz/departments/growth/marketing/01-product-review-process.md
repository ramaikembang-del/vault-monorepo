## Feature Prioritization Framework

**Scoring (0-10 each):**
- **Impact:** How many users benefit? Revenue impact?
- **Confidence:** How sure are we this will work?
- **Ease:** How easy to build?

**Priority Score:** (Impact × Confidence) / Ease

**Example:**
- Impact: 8 (many customers want this)
- Confidence: 7 (validated with research)
- Ease: 3 (complex to build)
- **Score:** (8 × 7) / 3 = 18.7
