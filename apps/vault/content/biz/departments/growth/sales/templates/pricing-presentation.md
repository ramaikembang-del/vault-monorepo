## Pricing Objection Handling (In Presentation)

### "Too expensive"

**Slide variant:** ROI slide
"Let's look at this as an investment, not a cost. You're investing Rp [X] to gain Rp [Y]. That's a [Z]% return."

### "Need cheaper option"

**Slide variant:** Show full tier comparison
"We have a free tier to start. You can upgrade when you see the value."
OR
"We can start with [lower tier] at Rp [X], then upgrade later."

### "Can we negotiate?"

**For enterprise only:**
"For annual contracts >Rp 50M, we can discuss custom pricing. Is that the range you're considering?"

**For SMB:**
"Our pricing is standard to keep it fair for all customers. However, we do offer discounts for:
- Annual payment (17% off)
- Referrals (Rp 50K credit per referral)"

---

## Delivery Tips

**Before showing pricing:**
- Confirm value (recap demo highlights)
- Ask: "Based on what you've seen, does this solve [their problem]?"

**When showing pricing:**
- Show highest value tier first (anchoring)
- Guide to recommended tier
- Pause and let them process

**After showing pricing:**
- Don't apologize for price
- Sit in silence (let them speak first)
- Answer questions directly

**Close:**
- "Which tier makes most sense for [Restaurant Name]?"
- Not "Do you want to buy?" but "Which one do you prefer?"
