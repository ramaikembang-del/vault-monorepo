**Pain Points:**

**Listen actively - take notes!**

---

## Transition to Solution (2 min)

**Summarize what you heard:**
"So if I understand correctly, you're looking for [restate their goals], and your main challenge is [their pain point]. Is that right?"

**Bridge to demo:**
"Based on what you've shared, I think our [Product Name] could be a great fit. Would you like to see a quick demo of how it addresses [their specific problem]?"

**Schedule demo:**
- Same call if time permits (15 min)
- Or schedule dedicated demo call

---

## Closing (2 min)

**Next Steps:**
- "I'll send you [proposal/demo invite/information] by [date]"
- "Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?"
- "Thank you again for your time, [Name]!"

**Log in CRM immediately after call**

---

## Post-Call Actions

- [ ] Update CRM notes
- [ ] Score the lead (Hot/Warm/Cold)
- [ ] Schedule demo or send follow-up email (within 24 hours)
- [ ] Add to nurture sequence if not ready now

---

## Red Flags (Disqualify)

- No budget, no authority, no timeline = "Stay in touch"
- Not using POS and unwilling to track manually = Poor fit
- "Just shopping around" with no intent to buy = Nurture
- Unrealistic expectations ("Will this double my revenue?") = Education needed

---

## Tips for Success

 **DO:**
- Listen 80%, talk 20%
- Ask follow-up "why" questions
- Take detailed notes
- Be genuinely curious about their business
- Find the real pain, not surface problem

 **DON'T:**
- Pitch products too early
- Interrupt
- Talk about features (talk about their problems)
- Assume you know their needs

**Practice this script 10 times before using with real customers!**
