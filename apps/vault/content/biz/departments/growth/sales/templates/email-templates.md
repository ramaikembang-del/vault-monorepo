## 1. Cold Outreach Email

**Subject:** Help [Restaurant Name] increase profit with better data?

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Restaurant Name] on [Google/Instagram/referral] and wanted to reach out.

Many Indonesian F&B owners we work with struggle with:
- Not knowing which menu items are actually profitable
- Spending hours creating reports in Excel
- Making pricing decisions based on gut feel

Does any of this resonate?

We built PWBI specifically for Indonesian restaurants to solve these problems. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if it might help [Restaurant Name]?

Best,
[Your Name]

## 6. Objection: "Too Expensive"

**Subject:** Re: PWBI Pricing

Hi [Name],

I understand budget is a concern. Let me break down the ROI:

**Your current cost of NOT having this:**
- [X] hours/month on manual reports = Rp [Y] (your time cost)
- Decisions made without data = missed opportunities

**PWBI cost:** Rp [Z]/month

**If PWBI helps you:**
- Save [X] hours/month (Rp [Y] value)
- Improve profit margin by just 2% = Rp [additional profit]

**Net benefit:** Rp [total value - cost]/month

We also offer:
- Payment plans (quarterly/annual with discount)
- Start with free tier, upgrade when you see value

Would either of those work better?

Best,
[Your Name]
