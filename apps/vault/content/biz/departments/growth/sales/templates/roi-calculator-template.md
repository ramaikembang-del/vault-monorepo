- Restaurant name: ________________
- Monthly revenue: Rp ________________
- Number of outlets: ________________

**Current Process:**
- Hours spent on reports/month: ________________
- Hourly cost of time: Rp ________________ (or use Rp 100K default)

---

### Benefit Calculations

**Time Savings:**
```
Current time: [X] hours/month
With PWBI: 1 hour/month
Time saved: [X-1] hours/month
Value: [X-1] Ã— Rp [hourly rate] = Rp [Y]/month
```

**Profit Improvement (Conservative Estimate):**
```
Current monthly revenue: Rp [R]
Current profit margin: [P]%
Current profit: Rp [R Ã— P%]

Expected improvement scenarios:
- Optimistic (5% margin improvement): +Rp [R Ã— 5%]/month
- Realistic (3% margin improvement): +Rp [R Ã— 3%]/month
- Conservative (1% margin improvement): +Rp [R Ã— 1%]/month

Use realistic for ROI calculation
```

**How PWBI drives profit improvement:**
1. Identify unprofitable menu items (adjust pricing/remove)
2. Reduce waste (spot over-ordering)
3. Optimize staffing (labor cost control)
4. Better vendor negotiations (data-driven)

### Cost Section

**PWBI Investment:**
- Product cost: Rp ________________/month
- Setup/implementation: Rp ________________ (one-time, if applicable)
- Training: Rp 0 (included)

**Total first month:** Rp [setup + monthly]
**Months 2+:** Rp [monthly only]

### ROI Calculation

**Monthly Value:**
```
Time savings value: Rp [A]
Profit improvement (3%): Rp [B]
Total monthly value: Rp [A+B]
```

**Monthly Cost:**
```
PWBI cost: Rp [C]
```

**Monthly NET Benefit:**
```
Rp [A+B-C] /month
```

**Payback Period:**
```
If one-time setup cost: [Setup cost] / [Monthly NET benefit] = [X] months
Otherwise: Immediate positive ROI
```

**Annual ROI:**
```
Annual benefit: Rp [(A+B) Ã— 12]
Annual cost: Rp [C Ã— 12]
Net annual benefit: Rp [(A+B-C) Ã— 12]

ROI %: [(Annual benefit - Annual cost) / Annual cost] Ã— 100
```

##Example Calculation

**Customer: Cafe Bandung**
- Monthly revenue: Rp 100M
- 1 outlet
- Current profit margin: 15%
- Time on reports: 10 hours/month

**Inputs:**
- Hourly cost: Rp 100K
- Current software: Rp 0

**Time Savings:**
- Current: 10 hours/month
- With PWBI: 1 hour/month
- Saved: 9 hours Ã— Rp 100K = Rp 900K/month

**Profit Improvement (3% conservative):**
- Current profit: Rp 100M Ã— 15% = Rp 15M/month
- Improvement: Rp 100M Ã— 3% = Rp 3M/month additional profit

**Total Monthly Value:**
- Rp 900K + Rp 3M = Rp 3.9M/month

**Cost:**
- E1 Dashboard Lite Paid: Rp 300K/month
- Setup: Rp 0
- Total: Rp 300K/month

**NET Monthly Benefit:**
- Rp 3.9M - Rp 300K = **Rp 3.6M/month**

**Annual ROI:**
- Annual benefit: Rp 3.9M Ã— 12 = Rp 46.8M
- Annual cost: Rp 300K Ã— 12 = Rp 3.6M
- Net benefit: Rp 43.2M/year
- ROI: 1,200% (12x return!)

**Payback: Immediate** (positive from month 1)

## How to Use

1. **Fill in customer info** during discovery call
2. **Calculate live** during demo if possible
3. **Include in proposal** to show value
4. **Use conservative estimates** (underpromise, overdeliver)
5. **Share spreadsheet** with customer so they can adjust assumptions

## Tips

- Use conservative numbers (1-3% improvement, not 5-10%)
- Show multiple scenarios (best/realistic/ conservative)
- Let customers adjust assumptions themselves
- Focus on profit improvement (bigger number than time savings)
- Compare to cost of NOT having data (missed opportunities)
