## Common Objections & Responses

### 1. "Too Expensive"

**What they're really saying:** "I don't see the value"

**Response:**
"I understand. Let me help you see the ROI:

Currently, you're spending [X] hours/month on manual reports. At Rp [Y]/hour, that's Rp [Z] in time cost.

PWBI costs Rp [A]/month but saves you those [X] hours PLUS helps you make better decisions.

For example, if you discover just ONE unprofitable menu item and fix it, that could be worth Rp [B]/month in extra profit.

When you look at it that way, does the investment make more sense?"

**Alternative:** Offer payment plan or start with lower tier

---

### 2. "I need to think about it"

**What they're really saying:** Hidden concern or not urgent

**Response:**
"Of course, I want you to feel confident. Can I ask - what specifically do you need to think about? Is it:
- Budget?
- Getting buy-in from someone?
- Technical concerns?
- Timing?

If I can address that now, it might help your decision."

**Then address the real concern**

---

### 3. "We'll just use Excel"

**What they're really saying:** Don't see the difference

**Response:**
"Many of our customers started with Excel too! The challenge they faced was:
- Hours of manual work every week
- Errors in formulas
- No real-time data (always working with old numbers)
- Can't easily see trends or patterns

PWBI automates all of that. Instead of spending Sunday night in Excel, you open the dashboard and see everything in 30 seconds.

How much time do you spend on Excel reporting now?"

---

### 4. "Can you add feature X?"

**What they're really saying:** Current product doesn't meet needs OR delay tactic

**Response:**
"That's interesting! Can you tell me more about why you need [feature X]?

[Listen to their answer]

Here's the good news: [If roadmap] That's actually on our roadmap for [timeline]
OR
[If workaround exists] While we don't have that exact feature, here's how you can achieve the same result: [workaround]

Would that work for you in the meantime?"

**Don't promise features not on roadmap!**

### 5. "We're already using [Competitor]"

**What they're really saying:** Need reason to switch

**Response:**
"That's great that you're already using analytics! What do you like about [Competitor]?

[Listen]

And what would you change if you could?

[Their pain points]

Here's how PWBI is different:
- [Difference 1 that addresses their pain]
- [Difference 2]
- [Indonesian F&B focus]

We make switching easy - we can help migrate your data. Want to see a side-by-side comparison?"

### 6. "We don't have a POS"

**What they're really saying:** Think PWBI won't work for them

**Response:**
"No problem at all! About 20% of our customers don't use POS.

You have two options:
1. Manual upload (CSV) - export from your current system, upload to PWBI
2. Direct entry - for smaller volumes, enter transactions in our web app

It's actually a great way to start tracking data if you haven't been.

Which sounds easier for your situation?"

---

### 7. "I need approval from [boss/partner]"

**What they're really saying:** Not the decision maker

**Response:**
"Understood. Who else needs to be involved in the decision?

Would it help if I presented to them as well? Or would you prefer I send you materials to share?

What concerns do you think they'll have? Let's address those upfront so you have strong answers."

**Offer to join their internal meeting**

---

### 8. "Not right now, maybe next quarter"

**What they're really saying:** Not urgent OR budget timing

**Response:**
"I understand timing is important. Can I ask - what's happening next quarter that makes it a better time?

[If end of quarter budget] That makes sense. Can I follow up with you in [month] to get on the calendar?

[If not urgent] What would make this more urgent? Usually businesses invest in analytics when [pain point]. Are you experiencing that?"

**Set specific follow-up date**

---

### 9. "We're too small for this"

**What they're really saying:** Think it's only for big businesses

**Response:**
"Actually, small businesses benefit most! Here's why:

Big chains have dedicated analysts. Small businesses like yours need tools that work without a data team.

Our smallest customers are single-location cafes making Rp 50M/month. They use PWBI to:
- Track daily sales in 30 seconds
- Know exactly what's profitable
- Make smart menu decisions

You're not too small - you're exactly who we built this for!"

---

### 10. "Let me talk to my accountant"

**What they're really saying:** Want expert opinion OR delay

**Response:**
"Great idea! Your accountant will probably love this because it makes their job easier.

Here's what you can tell them:
- PWBI exports to [accounting software]
- We're compliant with Indonesian tax requirements
- Saves them time requesting reports from you

Want me to send them some information directly? Or would you prefer a 3-way call to address any questions?"

---

## Objection Handling Framework

**1. Listen fully** - Don't interrupt
**2. Acknowledge** - "I understand..."
**3. Clarify** - "Can you tell me more about..."
**4. Respond** - Address the real concern
**5. Confirm** - "Does that answer your question?"
**6. Close** - "So are you ready to move forward?"

## When to Walk Away

**Red flags:**
- Wants custom development for standard price
- Unrealistic expectations ("Will this 10x my revenue?")
- Not willing to invest in their business
- Bad fit for product (too small, wrong industry)

**Response:**
"I don't think we're the right fit right now. Here's what I'd recommend instead: [alternative or advice]"

**Preserve relationship** - they might be ready later!

**Practice objection handling with role play before customer calls!**
