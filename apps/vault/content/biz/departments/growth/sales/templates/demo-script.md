## Product Overview (2 min)

**Don't dive into features yet!**

"PWBI helps Indonesian F&B businesses like yours make data-driven decisions. Instead of spending hours in Excel or guessing, you get real-time insights into sales, costs, and profitability."

**Show:** Home dashboard (just 10 seconds, overview only)

## Demo: Solve THEIR Problem (20 min)

### Structure: Problem → Solution → Value

**For each pain point they mentioned, show:**

1. **State their problem** (30 sec)
2. **Show solution in PWBI** (3-4 min)
3. **Highlight value/benefit** (30 sec)

### Example Flow: "I don't know which menu items are profitable"

**Problem:**
"You mentioned you're not sure which dishes are making you money and which are losing money. Let me show you..."

**Solution:**
[Navigate to Item Performance report]

"This is our Item Performance dashboard. Here you can see:
- Sales volume per item (Green Curry: 150 orders)
- Revenue per item (Rp 3M)
- COGS per item (Rp 900K)
- Profit margin (70% - excellent!)

Now look at this dish [point to low-margin item]:
- High sales (100 orders)
- But only 20% profit margin
- This is a 'Dog' in menu engineering - high volume, low profit"

**Value:**
"With this view, you can immediately see you should:
1. Raise the price on this low-margin dish
2. Promote your 70% margin dishes more
3. Potentially remove 'Dogs' from the menu

This alone could increase your profit by 10-15% without changing sales volume."

### Demo Tips

**Use THEIR business context:**
- "If you're a cafe, this would show your drinks vs food"
- "For your 3 locations, you'd see each outlet side-by-side"

**Use real F&B data:**
- Don't use dummy data or generic charts
- Use realistic Indonesian restaurant data

**Show,don't tell:**
- Click through the actual product
- Let them see how easy it is
- "You'd just click here... and filter to last month... done!"

**Keep it visual:**
- Charts, graphs, dashboards
- Minimize talking about "how it works"
- Focus on "what you'll see"

---

## Address Common Concerns (Built Into Demo)

**"Is it hard to set up?"**
→ Show: "Setup takes 15 minutes. Here's the POS connection screen - just enter your API key and we're syncing."

**"Will my data be secure?"**
→ Show: "See this padlock? Bank-level encryption. Only you can see your data, we use row-level security."

**"What if my POS isn't supported?"**
→ Show: "You can upload CSV. Here's the import screen - drag and drop your sales export."

## Pricing (3 min)

**After demo, before Q&A:**

"Based on what you've seen, which solution feels like the best fit for [Restaurant Name]?"

**Present pricing clearly:**

"For [Product], the investment is:
- [Tier 1]: Rp X/month - [What's included]
- [Tier 2]: Rp Y/month - [What's included]
- [Tier 3]: Rp Z/month - [What's included]

Most [cafes/restaurants like yours] start with [Tier 2]."

**ROI:**
"Based on your [X revenue], if this helps you improve profit margin by just 5%, that's Rp Y/month in extra profit. The tool pays for itself in [timeframe]."
