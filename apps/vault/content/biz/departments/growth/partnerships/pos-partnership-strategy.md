# POS Partnership Strategy  
**Strategic Integrations with Point-of-Sale Vendors**

**Owner:** Partnerships + Product  
**Status:** PLANNED - Year 2

---

## Strategic Rationale

**POS = Distribution Channel**
- Moka has 30K merchants
- Pawoon has 20K merchants  
- Qasir has 15K merchants
- **Total TAM:** 65K+ potential customers via partners

**Challenge:** Build vs Partner?
- Build: Own customer relationship, 100% margin
- Partner: Fast distribution, shared revenue (70/30 split)

**Decision:** Partner (scale faster than direct sales)

---

## Target Partners

### Tier 1: Strategic (Must-Have)

**Moka (Priority #1)**
- Market leader, 30K merchants
- Strong brand, trusted
- Offering: Basic analytics (not advanced)
- **Opportunity:** "Moka Analytics powered by Clario"

**Pawoon (Priority #2)**
- 20K merchants, growing fast
- F&B-focused (our sweet spot)
- Offering: No advanced analytics
- **Opportunity:** White-label partnership

---

### Tier 2: Tactical (Nice-to-Have)

**Qasir, Olsera, Kasir Pintar**
- Smaller but growing
- Less competitive pressure
- Easier to negotiate (need differentiation)

---

## Partnership Models

### Model 1: Reseller (Revenue Share)

**Structure:**
- POS Partner sells "Analytics Add-On" (Rp 200K/month)
- Revenue split: 70% Partner, 30% Clario
- We provide: Product, support, training
- They provide: Sales, customer relationship

**Example:** Moka sells to their 30K base, we get 30% of subscriptions

**Pros:** Fast distribution, leverage their brand  
**Cons:** Lower margin, dependence on partner

---

### Model 2: API Integration (Co-Sell)

**Structure:**
- Build API connection (Moka ↔ Clario)
- Both companies co-market
- Customer buys separately (Moka + Clario)
- No revenue share (independent)

**Pros:** Own customer, full margin  
**Cons:** Slower adoption, split customer attention

---

### Model 3: White-Label (OEM)

**Structure:**
- We build product
- Partner brands it as theirs ("Pawoon Analytics")
- One-time fee (Rp 50-100M) + monthly hosting fee
- They own customer relationship

**Pros:** Large upfront payment, recurring hosting fees  
**Cons:** No brand visibility, limited control

---

## Partnership Process

### Phase 1: Research & Outreach (Month 1-2)

**Steps:**
1. Research partner (size, offering, gaps)
2. Build business case (value prop for them)
3. Warm intro (via mutual contact if possible)
4. Initial meeting (pitch deck ready)

**Deliverables:**
- Partner analysis doc
- Pitch deck (customized per partner)
- Demo environment

---

### Phase 2: Pilot (Month 3-4)

**Scope:** Test with 10-20 of their customers

**Goals:**
- Validate technical integration
- Test customer demand
- Prove ROI (increased retention, upsell)

**Success Criteria:**
- >50% adoption (10+ of 20 test customers use it)
- NPS >7 (customers satisfied)
- Partner sees value (revenue or retention lift)

---

### Phase 3: Negotiation (Month 5)

**Terms to Negotiate:**
- Revenue split (70/30, 60/40, etc.)
- Exclusivity (are we exclusive to them?)
- Support responsibility (who handles tickets?)
- Marketing commitment (co-marketing budget?)

**Legal:**
- Partnership agreement (drafted by lawyer)
- SLA commitments
- IP ownership

---

### Phase 4: Launch (Month 6)

**Co-Marketing:**
- Joint press release
- Webinar ("Introducing Moka Analytics")
- Email to partner's customer base

**Integration:**
- API goes live
- Support team trained
- Monitoring enabled

---

### Phase 5: Optimize (Ongoing)

**Monthly Reviews:**
- Metrics: Adoption rate, revenue, support tickets
- Feedback: What's working, what's not?
- Roadmap: Feature requests from partner

**Annual Contract Renewal:**
- Renegotiate terms if needed
- Extend or terminate based on performance

---

## Success Metrics

**Partner Performance:**
- # of referrals/month
- Conversion rate (referral → customer)
- Revenue from partner channel

**Year 2 Targets:**
- 1-2 active partnerships
- 20% of revenue from partners (Rp 400M of Rp 2B total)
- Partner NPS >8

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Partner Builds In-House (Competes)**
- Mitigation: Long-term contract, exclusivity clause, make us essential (deep integration)

**Risk 2: Partner Provides Poor Support**
- Mitigation: SLA in contract, we monitor customer NPS by partner

**Risk 3: Over-Dependence on One Partner**
- Mitigation: Cap any partner at <30% of total revenue

---

## Pilot Proposal: Moka

**Offer to Moka:**
"We build 'Moka Analytics powered by Clario' - advanced F&B insights for your merchants"

**Value to Moka:**
- Increase ARPU (avg revenue per user): +Rp 200K/month
- Differentiation vs Pawoon (better analytics)
- Reduce churn (merchants stay for analytics)

**Value to Us:**
- 30K merchant distribution overnight
- 30% of subscription revenue (Rp 60K per customer/month)
- Validated at scale (proof for other partnerships)

**Pilot Scope:**
- 20 Moka merchants (F&B-heavy users)
- 3-month pilot (Feb-May 2027)
- Success = >50% adoption, NPS >7
