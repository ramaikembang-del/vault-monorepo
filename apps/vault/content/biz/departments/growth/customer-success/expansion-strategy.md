## Expansion Playbook

### Step 1: Identify Opportunity
**Data signals:**
- Usage frequency (logging in 5x/week = power user)
- Business growth (revenue up 50%+)
- Support requests ("Can you add X metric?")

**Manual triggers:**
- Quarterly Business Review (Pro+ customers)
- Annual renewal conversations

---

### Step 2: Build Business Case
**ROI Calculator:** Show value of upgrade

Example:
- Current: Tier 1, 1 outlet, Rp 50M revenue/year
- Potential: Tier 2, 3 outlets, Rp 180M revenue/year
- Value: "Consolidate 3 outlets into 1 dashboard = save 5 hours/week"

---

### Step 3: Present Offer
**Channels:**
- Email (for low-touch customers)
- Call (for Pro+ customers, Rp 1M+ LTV)
- In-app prompt (usage-based triggers)

**Timing:** Don't be pushy
- 60 days after initial purchase (let them use first)
- At renewal time (annual plans)
- After feature request (natural moment)

---

### Step 4: Close or Defer
**If Yes:** Process upgrade (invoice, deliver)  
**If No:** Document reason, revisit in 6 months  
**If Maybe:** Offer trial (1-month free Tier 2 trial)
