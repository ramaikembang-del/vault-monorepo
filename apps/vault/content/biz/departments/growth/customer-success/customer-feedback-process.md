# Customer Feedback Process

**Owner:** Customer Success & Product
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-09
**Goal:** systematically capture, categorize, and act on user feedback to drive product improvement and customer satisfaction.

## 1. Feedback Sources

We collect feedback from multiple channels:

*   **Support Tickets:** Bug reports, feature requests, and confusion points gathered from direct support interactions.
*   **Sales Calls:** Objections, features blockers, and competitor comparisons heard during the sales process.
*   **User Research:** Direct insights from discovery and validation interviews (see [[biz/templates/product/user-research-questions|User Research Questions]]).
*   **App/Product:** In-app feedback widgets, NPS surveys, and exit surveys.
*   **Community:** Comments on social media, forums, or direct messages.

## 2. Feedback Intake Workflow

### Step 1: Capture
All feedback should be logged centrally (e.g., in our Product Management tool or a central Feedback Tracker).
**Required fields:**
*   **User:** Who provided the feedback? (Name/Business)
*   **Source:** Where did it come from? (Support, Sales, etc.)
*   **Verbatim:** What exactly did they say? (Quote)
*   **Context:** What were they trying to do?

### Step 2: Categorize
Tag the feedback to help with analysis:
*   **Type:** Bug | Feature Request | UX Issue | Praise | Content/Data Issue
*   **Theme:** e.g., "Reporting", "Onboarding", "Billing", "Mobile App"
*   **Impact:** High | Medium | Low (How much does this affect the user's ability to get value?)

### Step 3: Triage (Weekly)
Product and CS meet weekly to review new feedback items.
*   **Bugs** -> Routed to Engineering (Jira).
*   **Features** -> Added to Product Roadmap backlog for prioritization.
*   **Quick Wins** -> Scheduled for immediate action.

## 3. Closing the Loop

It is critical to let users know their voice was heard.

*   **Receipt:** "Thanks for sharing! I've passed this to the product team." (Immediate)
*   **Update:** "We're working on that feature you asked for!" (When development starts)
*   **Resolution:** "It's live! Here's how to use it." (Upon release)

## 4. Periodic Review

*   **Monthly:** Analyze trends. Are we seeing a spike in specific request types?
*   **Quarterly:** Review "Won't Do" items. If a request keeps coming up, should we reconsider?
