## Renewal Red Flags

## Retention Tactics

### Tactic 1: Win-Back Discount
**For:** Customers who threaten to cancel  
**Offer:** 20-30% off next year  
**Limit:** Use sparingly (max 10% of customers, or everyone expects it)

### Tactic 2: Feature Upgrades
**For:** Customers who want more but hesitant to pay  
** Offer:** Free trial of Pro tier for 30 days  
**Goal:** Show value, convert to higher tier

### Tactic 3: Pause Option
**For:** Customers with temporary cash flow issues  
**Offer:** Pause subscription for 3 months (data retained)  
**Better than:** Full cancellation (easier to reactivate)

## Renewal Metrics

**Target Renewal Rates:**
- SaaS Basic: >85% annual renewal
- SaaS Pro: >90%
- Enterprise: >95%

**Track:**
- Renewal rate by cohort (Month 1 vs Month 12)
- Churn reasons (price, usage, competitor, other)
- Win-back success rate (how many saved with discount?)

---

## Exit Interviews

**If Customer Cancels:**
- Email survey: "Why did you leave?"
- Offer call (for Pro+ customers)

**Learn:**
- Was it price? (consider lowering)
- Was it product? (feature gaps)
- Was it us? (poor support)

**Use:** Improve product/service to reduce future churn
