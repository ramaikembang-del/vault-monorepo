## What is a Hackathon?

**A focused 2-day event where teams build prototypes to solve problems or explore new ideas.**

**Goals:**
- Rapid innovation (build things we wouldn't normally prioritize)

## Themes

### Past Themes

**Q4 2025:** "Customer Delight" - Make customers say "wow"
**Q3 2025:** "Internal Tools" - Build things that help us work better
**Q2 2025:** "AI Everything" - Use AI to solve problems

### How Themes Work

**Announced:** Morning of Day 1 (keeps it fresh, prevents pre-work)

**Interpretation:** Flexible
- Theme is guide, not constraint
- "Customer Delight" could be feature, UX improvement, support tool, etc.

**No theme police:** Build what excites you (loosely related to theme)

## Team Formation

### Team Size

**Ideal:** 3-4 people
**Min:** 2 (pair programming)
**Max:** 5 (too many = coordination overhead)

### Team Composition

**Recommended:** Cross-functional

- Multiple engineers with different expertise
- CS + Engineer (solve customer problems)

**Solo hacking:** Allowed but harder to win (less scope)

### How to Form Teams

**Option 1:** Come with team (coordinate before)
**Option 2:** Form during kickoff (pitch ideas, find teammates)
**Option 3:** Sign up solo, we'll match you

**Slack channel:** #hackathon (start pitching ideas week before)

## Demo Guidelines

### 5-Minute Demo Format

**Minute 1: Problem**
- What problem are you solving?
- Why does it matter?

**Minutes 2-4: Demo**
- Show the prototype working
- Highlight key features
- "Show, don't tell"

**Minute 5: Impact & Next Steps**
- Who benefits?
- What would it take to ship?
- Q&A

### Presentation Tips

**Do:**
- Rehearse (time yourself)
- Show working demo (live or video)
- Tell story (problem → solution → impact)
- Be enthusiastic

**Don't:**
- Read slides word-for-word
- Spend time on setup/logistics
- Apologize for what doesn't work
- Go over time (hard 5 min cutoff)

**Technical difficulties:** Have backup (video recording)

## Post-Hackathon

### What Happens to Winning Ideas?

**Product reviews (week after):**
- Fits roadmap? → Spec → Build → Ship
- Interesting but not now? → Backlog
- Great hack but not product? → Open-source or document

**Fast-track path (1st place):**
- Skip normal prioritization
- Assigned to team Q+1
- Original hackers consulted (or lead build)

**Success stories:**
- WhatsApp notifications: Hackathon → shipped in 3 weeks → #1 feature
- Dark mode: Hackathon → refined → shipped
- Invoice auto-gen: Hackathon → saved CS 10 hours/week

### Learning Artifacts

**All teams document:**
- What you built
- What you learned
- What you'd do differently
- Code repo (if shareable)

**Shared in:** #hackathon channel + wiki

## Tips for Success

### Before Hackathon

**Week Before:**
- Browse #hackathon for team/idea pitches
- Think about problems worth solving
- Check tech tools you might need (API keys, etc.)

**Day Before:**
- Get good sleep (2 days = marathon)
- Clear calendar (minimize distractions)
- Get excited!

### During Hackathon

**Scope smartly:**
- Small, working > big, broken
- Cut features aggressively
- "What's the minimum to demo impact?"

**Time management:**
- Reserve 3 hours for demo prep (Friday noon)
- Don't code until last minute
- Practice presentation

**Ask for help:**
- Stuck? Ask mentors
- Need design asset? Ask designer
- Technical blocker? Pair with senior

### Avoid Common Mistakes

**Don't:**
- Over-scope (build entire platform in 2 days)
- Ignore presentation (brilliant idea, bad demo = lose)
- Work solo (collaboration = better results + more fun)
- Stress too much (it's supposed to be fun)

## FAQ

**Q: Do I have to participate?**
A: No, but highly encouraged. It's fun + great for career (visibility, learning).

**Q: What if I'm not an engineer?**
A: Perfect! We need designers, PMs, CS reps. Non-technical ideas welcome.

**Q: Can I work from home?**
A: Yes, fully remote-friendly. Office is available if you prefer.

**Q: What if my idea doesn't work?**
A: Pivot or document the learning. Failure is ok (it's a hackathon, not production).

**Q: Can I use this for my OKRs?**
A: No, hackathon time doesn't count toward sprint work. It's separate.

**Q: What about my regular work?**
A: Hackathon days are work days. Regular work is paused.

**Q: Can customers participate?**
A: Not yet, but we're exploring "customer co-creation" events.
