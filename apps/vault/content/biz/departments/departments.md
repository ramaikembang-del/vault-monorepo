# Operational Departments (Business Functions)

**Purpose:** The execution layer of PWBI F&B Growth. While Strategy defines the "Why" and "What", these departments execute the "How". We have consolidated all functions here to align with the "Smart Solo" (Phase 1) structure.

## Structure Philosophy (Smart Solo)
In Phase 1, the Founder wears all these hats.
- **Monday:** Growth (Marketing)
- **Tuesday:** Ops & Finance
- **Wednesday:** Product
- **Thursday:** Sales
- **Friday:** Admin (HR/Legal)

Each folder contains the **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** to eventually delegate these roles to future hires.
