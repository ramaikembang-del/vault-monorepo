## Our Mission

**"Empower every F&B business in Indonesia to make data-driven decisions and achieve operational excellence."**

We believe that F&B businesses—from small cafés to large restaurant chains—deserve access to world-class analytics and operational tools. Our mission is to democratize business intelligence for the F&B industry.

---

## Our Vision

By 2030, PWBI becomes the operating system for F&B businesses across Southeast Asia, powering 50,000+ businesses with actionable insights and seamless operations.

## Core Values

### 1. Customer Obsession

**Definition:** We start with the customer and work backwards. Every decision asks: "Does this help our customers succeed?"

**In Practice:**
- Read customer feedback daily (not just quarterly)
- Talk to customers weekly (founding team + all team members)
- Measure success by customer outcomes, not just revenue
- Build features customers need, not what's trendy

**Example:** When designing A4a Inventory Optimizer, we spent 100 hours interviewing café owners about inventory pain points before writing a single line of code.

---

### 2. Bias for Action

**Definition:** Speed matters. Make reversible decisions quickly; deliberate on irreversible ones.

**In Practice:**
- "Done is better than perfect" (80% solution shipped beats 100% solution delayed)
- Two-way door decisions: Decide in hours, not weeks
- One-way door decisions: Sleep on it, but decide within 3 days
- Experiment mindset: Test, learn, iterate

**Example:** When a customer requested WhatsApp notifications, we shipped a basic version in 48 hours using Twilio. Got feedback, iterated. Now it's our most-used feature.

---

### 3. High Standards

**Definition:** We have relentlessly high standards. What's "good enough" for most isn't good enough for us.

**In Practice:**
- Code reviews are mandatory (no shortcuts)
- "Would I use this myself?" quality bar
- Data accuracy > speed (wrong data worse than no data)
- Documentation is not optional
- Design matters (ugly = unusable)

**Example:** We delayed A4a launch by 2 weeks to achieve 95%+ forecast accuracy. Could've shipped at 85%, but that wouldn't meet our standard.

---

### 4. Ownership & Accountability

**Definition:** Act like an owner. See something broken? Fix it. Don't wait for someone else.

**In Practice:**
- "Not my job" doesn't exist here
- Own outcomes, not just tasks
- Escalate early (hiding problems = failure)
- Learn from mistakes (blameless post-mortems)
- Help teammates (we win/lose as a team)

**Example:** Engineer noticed confusing UX in billing. Didn't file a ticket. Designed better flow, implemented it, shipped. That's ownership.

---

### 5. Frugality & Efficiency

**Definition:** Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed creativity.

**In Practice:**
- Question every expense (is this necessary?)
- Build vs buy analysis (don't over-engineer)
- Automate repetitive tasks
- "Cost of delay" thinking (time = money)
- Sustainable growth (not "growth at all costs")

**Example:** Built internal tool for customer onboarding instead of buying Rp 200M/year SaaS product. Saved money, got exactly what we needed.

---

### 6. Transparency & Candor

**Definition:** Default to open. Share information widely. Speak truth respectfully.

**In Practice:**
- Financials shared monthly (with all team)
- Roadmap is public (customers see what's coming)
- Retrospectives are brutally honest
- Disagree and commit (voice concerns, then align)
- Feedback is a gift (give it, receive it gracefully)

**Example:** When we missed Q3 targets, we shared why (overestimated sales pipeline) with entire team. Led to better forecasting process.

---

### 7. Learn & Grow

**Definition:** Stay curious. Yesterday's expertise is tomorrow's obsolescence.

**In Practice:**
- Learning budget: Rp 5M/person/year (books, courses, conferences)
- Friday learning time (4 hours/week for skill development)
- Share learnings (weekly demos, write-ups)
- Teach others (mentoring expected)
- Embrace failure (tried & failed > never tried)

**Example:** Backend engineer wanted to learn ML. Spent Fridays on it for 3 months. Now builds our forecasting algorithms. That's growth mindset.

---

## Values in Conflict

Sometimes values conflict. Here's how we prioritize:

**Customer Obsession > Bias for Action**
- Don't ship fast if it hurts customers
- Speed matters, but quality for customers matters more

**High Standards > Frugality**
- Invest in quality where it touches customers
- Cut costs on internal tools, not customer-facing features

**Transparency > Short-term comfort**
- Share bad news (better to know than be blindsided)
- Trust team with truth (they're adults)

---

## Living Our Values

### In Hiring
- Interview for values fit (cultural add, not cultural fit)
- Values-based questions in interviews
- Team votes on values alignment

### In Performance Reviews
- 50% what you achieved, 50% how (values alignment)
- Values violations = serious (can be firing offense)
- Model values = get promoted

### In Daily Work
- Start meetings: "Which value does this decision align with?"
- End week: "How did I live our values this week?"
- Celebrate values wins (shout-outs in Slack)

## Our Culture, Described by Team

> "I've never worked somewhere where I can be this honest. Transparency actually means something here."
> — Dina, Product Manager

> "High standards, but not in a toxic way. We push each other to be better, but support each other when we fall short."

> "Customer obsession is real. We actually talk to customers. Management doesn't hide in ivory tower."

## Anti-Values (What We're Not)

**Not a "work is family" culture**
- Work is work. Family is family. We respect boundaries.

**Not "move fast and break things"**
- Move fast, but don't break customer trust. Data accuracy matters.

**Not "genius" culture**
- Smart, humble, collaborative people > lone geniuses

**Not "hustle porn"**
- Sustainable pace. Burnout helps no one.

**Not "consensus" culture**
- Disagree and commit. Not everyone gets a vote on everything.

## Updating Our Values

Values should evolve as we grow. How to suggest changes:

1. Discuss with your team (is this resonating?)
2. Bring to quarterly all-hands
3. Leadership considers (with team input)
4. Vote (2/3 majority to change)

**Next review:** June 2025
