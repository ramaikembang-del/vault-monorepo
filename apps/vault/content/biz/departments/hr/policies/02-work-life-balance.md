# Work-Life Balance Policy

**Owner:** HR + Leadership
**Last Updated:** December 2025

---

## Our Philosophy

**Sustainable pace wins marathons.** Burnout helps no one. We value productivity over presence, outcomes over hours.

**Work is important. Life is more important.**

---

## Work Hours

### Flexible Hours

**Core hours:** 10 AM - 3 PM WIB (required overlap)
**Total:** 40 hours/week (flexible when)

**Examples of flexibility:**
- Early bird: 7 AM - 4 PM
- Night owl: 11 AM - 8 PM
- Parent: 9 AM - 3 PM, resume 8 PM - 10 PM

**Track hours:** Honor system (log in HRIS)
**No micromanagement:** We trust you

### Overtime

**Policy:** Discouraged

**If happens:**
- Discuss with manager (why? is it sustainable?)
- Take time back (worked Saturday? Take Monday off)
- Not a badge of honor (working 60 hours ≠ hero)

**Red flag:** Consistent overtime = workload issue, not dedication issue

---

## Time Off

### Vacation Days

**Minimum:** 12 days/year (Indonesian law)
**Our policy:** 20 days/year + public holidays

**Encouraged:**
- Use them all (empty PTO bank = not dedicated, = bad planning)
- Plan ahead (coordinate with team)
- Actually disconnect (no Slack checking)

**Mandatory:** Minimum 10 days used per year

### Sick Leave

**Policy:** Unlimited (within reason)

**How it works:**
- Feeling sick? Rest.
- Notify manager + team (not asking permission, informing)
- No doctor's note required (< 3 days)
- Longer illness: Discuss with HR (accommodation, support)

**Mental health = health:** Sick day includes mental health days

### Personal Days

**5 days/year** for:
- Family emergencies
- Moving
- Important appointments
- Life happens

**No questions asked:** Just notify team

### Parental Leave

**Maternity:** 3 months paid (Indonesian law + PWBI top-up)
**Paternity:** 1 month paid
**Adoption:** Same as birth

**Return:** Flexible (part-time ramp-up ok for 1 month)

### Sabbatical

**After 5 years:** 1-month paid sabbatical
**After 10 years:** 2-month paid sabbatical

**Purpose:** Recharge, learn, travel, pursue passion project

---

## Boundaries

### After-Hours Communication

**Sending messages:** Ok (use schedule send feature)
**Responding:** NOT expected

**Evenings/weekends:**
- Non-urgent: Ignore until next business day
- Urgent: We'll call (rarely happens)

**Slack status:** "Do not disturb" respected

### "Right to Disconnect"

**You have the right to:**
- Not check email after 6 PM
- Not respond to Slack on weekends
- Take lunch away from desk
- Decline after-hours meetings

**Manager's role:** Model this behavior (don't send late-night messages)

### Meeting-Free Time

**Personal focus blocks:** Encouraged

**Company-wide:**
- No meetings before 10 AM
- No meetings after 5 PM
- Friday afternoons: No meetings (focus/wrap-up time)

---

## Mental Health Support

### Resources

**EAP (Employee Assistance Program):**
- Confidential counseling (up to 8 sessions/year)
- 24/7 hotline
- Family members included

**Mental Health Budget:** Rp 10M/year
- Therapy
- Apps (Headspace, Calm, BetterHelp)
- Wellness programs

**Mental Health Days:** No stigma, treated like sick days

### Signs of Burnout

**Watch for:**
- Chronic exhaustion
- Cynicism about work
- Reduced performance
- Physical symptoms (headaches, insomnia)

**What to do:**
- Talk to manager/HR (confidential)
- Reduce workload temporarily
- Take time off
- Seek professional help (we'll support)

---

## Preventing Burnout

### Load Management

**Projects:**
- Realistic deadlines (no artificial urgency)
- Buffer time (things take longer than estimated)
- Say no (can't do everything)

**On-call/support:**
- Rotates across team
- Capped hours (max 1 week/month)
- Comp time for weekend work

### Workload Check-Ins

**Weekly 1:1s:**
- "How's your workload?"
- "What can I take off your plate?"
- "Are you able to disconnect?"

**Red flags:**
- Consistently working late
- Not taking breaks
- Stressed/short-tempered
- Quality declining

**Action:** Redistribute work, hire, delay non-critical projects

---

## Flexibility & Accommodations

### Life Happens

**Flexible for:**
- Kid sick? Work from home (or take day off)
- Doctor appointment? Shift hours
- Family emergency? Drop everything
- Moving? Take personal day

**Just communicate:** Slack #out-of-office

### Special Accommodations

**We accommodate:**
- Disabilities (reasonable accommodations provided)
- Religious observances (flexible scheduling)
- Caregiving responsibilities (flexible hours)
- Chronic conditions (work from home, adjusted hours)

**Process:** Discuss with HR, we'll find solution

---

## Vacation Planning

### How to Request

1. Check team calendar (avoid conflicts)
2. Get manager approval (usually automatic)
3. Update Slack status
4. Set email auto-reply
5. Assign coverage (who handles urgent issues?)

**Advance notice:**
- < 3 days: 2 weeks notice
- 1-2 weeks: 1 month notice
- > 2 weeks: 2 months notice (for coverage planning)

### While on Vacation

**You should:**
- Actually disconnect (laptop stays home)
- Auto-reply mentions who to contact
- Catch up when you return (not during)

**We won't:**
- Contact you (unless world-ending emergency)
- Expect you to check messages
- Judge you for being unavailable

**Return:** No backlog guilt. We managed.

---

## Company Culture Norms

### "Always On" is Not Valued

**We celebrate:**
- Getting work done efficiently
- Taking breaks
- Going home on time
- Using PTO

**We don't celebrate:**
- Working weekends
- Responding at midnight
- Skipping lunch
- Never taking vacation

**Leadership models this:** Founding Team takes PTO, disconnects, talks about balance

### Productivity ≠ Hours

**Measured by:**
- Quality of work
- Meeting commitments
- Impact on customers/business
- Collaboration with team

**Not measured by:**
- Hours online
- Response speed (outside core hours)
- Slack presence
- Face time (in-office)

---

## Quarterly "Recharge Week"

**Last week of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4:** Company-wide slow week

**What happens:**
- No external meetings
- No new projects started
- Wrap up current work
- Planning for next quarter
- Learning/development time
- Catch up on docs

**Purpose:** Built-in breather 4x/year

---

## Dealing with Crunch Time

### When It Happens

**Rare circumstances:**
- Major product launch
- Customer emergency (P0 incident)
- Critical deadline (funding round, etc.)

**How we handle:**
- All-hands on deck
- Clear end date ("This week only")
- Comp time after (equal hours off)
- Retrospective (how to prevent next time?)

**Not sustainable:** If "crunch time" is every month, we have a planning problem, not a dedication problem

---

## Remote-Specific Balance

### Challenges

**Hard to "leave" office (when office = home)**

**Solutions:**
- Physical separator (close laptop, put in drawer)
- End-of-day ritual (shutdown routine)
- Change clothes (pajamas ≠ work clothes)
- Take walk (mark end of day)

### Overworking Risk

**Because laptop is always there...**

**Prevent:**
- Set working hours (stick to them)
- Auto-shutdown reminders (Slack bot)
- Separate workspace (don't work from bed)
- Manager check-ins (enforcing boundaries)

---

## For Managers

### Your Role in Balance

**Model it:**
- Take PTO (team sees it's ok)
- Don't send late messages (or schedule send)
- Talk about rest ("I'm tired, taking day off")

**Enforce it:**
- "Why aren't you using PTO?" conversations
- Decline overtime requests (hire, not overwork)
- Notice burnout signs (action early)

**Support it:**
- Approve time off (default yes)
- Redistribute work (avoid overload)
- Flex hours (life happens)

**Measure it:**
- Retention rate (burnout = quitting)
- Engagement surveys (checking pulse)
- 1:1s (honest conversations)
