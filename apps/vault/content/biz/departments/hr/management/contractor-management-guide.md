## Legal & Compliance

### Indonesian Labor Law

**Key Differences: Contractor vs. Employee:**

| Aspect        | Contractor                | Employee                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Control**   | Self-directed, own hours  | Company sets hours, supervises |
| **Equipment** | Own tools, software       | Company provides               |
| **Benefits**  | None (health, pension)    | BPJS, THR required             |
| **Taxes**     | Self-reported (PPh 21)    | Company withholds              |
| **Duration**  | Project-based, <12 months | Indefinite or fixed-term       |

> [!WARNING]
> **Misclassification Risk:** If contractor works >12 months continuously, full-time hours, and is heavily supervised, they may be deemed an employee under Indonesian law. Consult legal advisor.

---

### Tax Implications

**Contractor Taxes (Their Responsibility):**
- Income tax (PPh 21): Self-reported
- VAT (if applicable): Invoice must include 11% PPN

**Company Obligations:**
- No tax withholding for true contractors
- Keep invoices for expense deduction

**Recommendation:** Contractors should have NPWP (tax ID) for legitimate invoicing.

---

## Best Practices
