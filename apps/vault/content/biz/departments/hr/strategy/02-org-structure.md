## Executive Summary

**The "2-Person Founding Team" Approach:**
We start with a **2-person founding team** with complementary skills (Field Operations & Product Development + Strategy & Technical Architecture). This is intentionally under-hiring in Year 1 to maximize equity value and execution capacity.

**Hiring Strategy Roadmap:**
- **Phase 1 (Month 1-9):** **The Founding Team.** Focus: Validation & Market Penetration. (Field Ops Partner + Strategy Partner).
- **Phase 2 (Month 9+):** **The Technical Scale.** Focus: Stability. (2 Founders + Hire 1: Technical or Product/Marketing specialist).
- **Phase 3 (Year 2):** **The Expansion.** Focus: Specialization.

**Financial Evolution:**
- **Burn Rate:** Very low cash burn (both partners prioritize equity over salary).
- **Equity Pool:** Co-founder split TBD, with 25-35% reserved for early team hires.

## Phase 1: Solo Founder (Months 1-6)

**Objective:** Prove something people want.

### 1. Trigger to Exit Phase 1
You do not just "hire" for Phase 2. You **partner up** when:
* **Revenue:** >Rp 50M MRR (or clear path to it).
* **Product:** The MVP works but lacks deep "Industry Nuance".
* **Bottleneck:** You have generic tech/startup skills, but lack deep "Service & Hospitality" credibility to close Enterprise deals.

### 2. The Founder's "Hat Rack"
In this phase, you are a **Product Engineer who Sells**.

| Hat | % Time | Key Activities | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Builder** | 50% | Coding MVP, db schema, bug fixes. | Weekly Ship Rate |
| **Seller** | 30% | Direct DM outreach, demos, closing. | # Demos Booked |
| **Support** | 10% | Manual onboarding, bug triage. | Response Time <4h |
| **Admin** | 10% | Invoicing, legal setup. | Cash Collected |

## Phase 2: The Strategic Partnership (Months 6-12)

**Objective:** Product-Market Fit & The "Growth Engine".

### 1. The Org Chart (The "Team of Two")
```
The Builder (Tech Founder) The Operator (Hospitality Partner)
(Co-CEO / CTO Structure)
```

### 2. Deep Dive: The Partner (Hire 1)
**Role:** Founding Partner (Growth & Operations)
**Concept:** This is **not** a salesperson. This is a **Hospitality Domain Expert** who co-founds the business side.

**Profile (The "Unfair Advantage"):**
* **Background:** Ex-GM of a Hotel Group, F&B Consultant, or Failed Restaurateur.
* **Superpower:** Speaks the language of "Food Cost", "Table Turns", and "Inventory Shrinkage" natively.
* **Why they join:** They know the *problem* intimately but can't build the *solution* (code).

**Key Responsibilities:**
* **Product Definition (Voice of Industry):** "The dashboard is wrong. Chefs don't look at graphs; they look at 'Low Stock' alerts. Build *this* instead."
* **Credibility Sales:** Closing deals not by "selling", but by consulting. "I used to run 5 outlets; here is how I fixed my COGS using this tool."
* **Network Distribution:** Opening doors to Restaurant Groups that a "Tech Bro" founder could never access.

**Day in the Life (Phase 2):**
* **09:00:** Coffee with a Restaurant Owner (Sales/Discovery).
* **11:00:** Review Product Mockups with Builder ("This button is too small for a kitchen tablet").
* **13:00:** Write a "State of F&B" LinkedIn article (Thought Leadership).
* **15:00:** Onboard a new client personally (Training their staff).
* **17:00:** Strategy Sync with Builder (Roadmap adjustments).

### 3. The Founder's Shift
* **From:** Guessing what features to build.
* **To:** Building exactly what the Partner validates is needed.
* **Dynamic:** The Partner brings the **"What"** (Market Needs). The Builder brings the **"How"** (Tech Solution).

---

## Phase 3: The Triad (Year 2)

**Objective:** Stabilize Tech & Scale Support.

### 1. The Org Chart
```
The Builder (CTO/Product) The Operator (CEO/CRO)
 Hire 2: The Tech (Founding Engineer)
```

### 2. Deep Dive: Hire 2 (The Tech)
A "Full Stack Plumber" to execute the roadmap defined by the Founders.

**Profile:**
* Polyglot developer (JS/Python).
* Loves "Shipping" more than "Perfect Code".

**Key Responsibilities:**
* **Feature Dev:** Taking the spec from the Operator (refined by Builder) and shipping it.
* **Infrastructure:** AWS/GCP management, CI/CD pipelines.
* **Bug Smasher:** Killing the technical debt.

### 3. The New Dynamic
* **Builder:** Vision, Investor Relations, High-Level Architecture.
* **Operator:** Revenue, Product Strategy (Functional), Customer Happiness.
* **Tech:** Code Velocity, Uptime, Security.

---

## Phase 4: Expansion (Year 2+)

**Objective:** Specialization. Moving from "Generalists" to "Experts".

### 1. The Trigger
* **Revenue:** >Rp 250M MRR.
* **Team:** 3 Core + Contractors.
* **Need:** "We need someone who does *just* Ads 40 hours a week."

### 2. The Org Chart (7-10 People)
```
Founding Operator (CEO) ______ Founding Builder (CTO)
 Head of Growth Tech Lead
 Sales Rep Backend Dev
 Content Lead Frontend Dev
 Customer Success Lead
```

### 3. Key Changes
* **Founders Split C-Level:** One focuses on Market (CEO/CRO), one on Product/Tech (CTO/CPO).
* **First Manager Layer:** The Founders stop "doing" everything and start managing departments.

## Compensation Philosophy (Detailed)

### 1. The "Equity Bridge" Model
The Operator is a **Partner**, meaning they take **Founder-level Equity**.

| Role | Market Value | Our Cash Offer | "Gap" | Equity Offer | Vesting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ops Partner** | Rp 25-35M (GM Level) | Rp 5-7.5M | High | **20-30%** | 4Y, 1Y Cliff |
| **Tech Lead** | Rp 18-25M | Rp 7.5-10M | Med | 10-15% | 4Y, 1Y Cliff |
| **Phase 4 Hire**| Rp 10M | Rp 10M | None | 0.5% (ESOP) | 4Y, 1Y Cliff |

### 2. Salary Normalization
* **Trigger:** Series A Funding OR Rp 1B ARR.
* **Action:** All early team members get bumped to Market Rate Cash. The Partner's equity makes them "Owner Status".

---

## Performance Management Culture

### 1. The "Keeper Test" (Netflix Style)
> "If this person told me they were leaving, would I fight to keep them?"
> * **If Yes:** They are in the right seat.
> * **If No:** We made a hiring mistake. Fix it fast.

### 2. Probation Milestones (The First 90 Days)
* **Month 1:** **Deep Validation.** Partner audits the product and tears it apart based on industry reality.
* **Month 2:** **First Big Wins.** Partner brings in 3-5 "Friends & Family" deals from their network.
* **Month 3:** **Roadmap Ownership.** Partner defines the Q2 Product Roadmap.

---

## Remote & Asynchronous Policy

**We are Remote-First, not Remote-Only.**

### 1. The "Deep Work" Default
* **No Meetings:** Tuesdays and Thursdays are "No Meeting Days".
* **Async Over Sync:** If it can be a Loom or a Linear comment, don't call.
* **Written Culture:** Decisions are documented (Notion), not decided in hallway chats.

### 2. The "Sync" Moments
* **Weekly Sprint:** Monday 10:00 AM (30 min). All hands.
* **The "Jam Session":** Friday PM (Optional) - Co-working at a cafe/WeWork.
* **Quarterly Offsite:** 2 Days. Deep strategy + Bonding. (Paid by company).

## Risk Mitigation Matrix

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Partner Misalignment** | Partner wants "Safe Salary", Founder wants "Growth". | **Radical Candor.** Equity discussions must be brutal and upfront. |
| **Skill Gap** | Partner knows Hospitality but can't use Tech tools (Linear, Notion). | **Tools Training.** Builder spends Week 1 training Partner on the "SaaS Operating System". |
| **Founder Conflict** | Who is CEO? | **RACI Clarity.** Split by specific domains (Tech vs Market). |
| **Burnout** | 80h weeks sustain for 3 months, then crash. | **Velocity vs Volume.** We focus on the "One Thing". Mandatory time off. |
