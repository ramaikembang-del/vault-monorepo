# Hiring Playbook - Early Stage Team Building

**PWBI F&B Growth**
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-05
**Source of Truth:** `compensation/01-early-team-compensation.md`

> [!NOTE]
> **Current Team Context:** This playbook is for the **first hire** by the existing 2-person founding team (Field Ops & Prod Dev Partner + Strategy & Tech Partner). References to "Founder" below refer to the founding team collectively making hiring decisions.
>
> **Philosophy:** We are not recruiting an employee. We are scouting a **Co-Founding Partner** (Hire #1).
> **The Target:** A "Hospitality Veteran" (Ex-GM, Restaurateur) who wants to build tech, not a "Tech Sales Rep" who wants a job.
> **The Standard:** This is the most critical decision of the company's life. We prioritize "False Negatives" (rejecting good people) over "False Positives" (hiring the wrong person).

## Hiring Process Overview

**Timeline:** 3-5 weeks for Core Team (Partner/Tech levels).
**Success Metric:** "Does this person know more about the customer's problem than I do?"

**The 8-Stage Workflow:**
1. **Requisition:** Profile Definition & Equity Modeling (The "Who")
2. **Scouting:** Hyper-Targeted Outreach (The "Hunt")
3. **Screening:** Portfolio & History Review (The "Filter")
4. **Vision Call:** The "Coffee Chat" (The "Hook")
5. **Assessment:** The Paid Trial (The "Proof")
6. **Deep Dive:** Strategy Session & "Airport Test" (The "Vibe")
7. **References:** Backchannel Consistency Check (The "Truth")
8. **Offer:** Equity & Vesting Agreement (The "Deal")

---

## Stage 1: Requisition (Profile Definition)

**Objective:** Define exactly who we need so we recognize them instantly. Avoid "Generic" JDs.

### Why This Matters
For this specific product (F&B Analytics), technical skill alone fails. We need "Domain Credibility." A typical SaaS Sales Rep can memorize a script, but they cannot empathize with a Restaurant Owner who is worried about food cost variance or pilferage in the kitchen.

If we hire a "Salesperson", they will try to sell software. If we hire a "Hospitality Partner", they will sell a **solution to a painful problem** they have personally experienced. This difference is what separates a product that "looks nice" from a product that becomes the "Operating System" of the client's business.

### How to Execute: Step-by-Step

#### 1. The Gap Analysis
Before opening the role, the Founder must perform a ruthless self-audit:
* **The Founder's Strength:** "I can build code, design databases, and ensure the system is secure."
* **The Founder's Weakness:** "I don't know the daily hell of a restaurant manager. I don't know the nuanced difference between 'Gross Profit' and 'Prime Cost' in the context of a Jakarta cafe."
* **The Gap:** We need someone who speaks the language of the kitchen natively. We need someone who can walk into a chaotic service and instantly spot the operational inefficiencies.

#### 2. The Persona Definition
We are looking for an **"Operator-Turned-Builder"**. This is a specific psychographic.

| Attribute | The "Sales Rep" (Avoid) | The "Partner" (Hire) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background** | SaaS Sales, Lead Gen Agency, Digital Marketing | **Ex-General Manager, Failed Restaurateur, F&B Consultant** |
| **Credibility** | "I have a great software for you." | "I know your food cost is 35%. I ran a place in Kemang and fixed mine using this." |
| **Product Input** | "Can we change the logo color?" | "Chefs won't use this. The buttons are too small for wet hands. Change workflow X." |
| **Motivation** | Commission, Salary, Perks | Equity, Autonomy, Solving the Industry Problem |
| **Risk Profile** | Low (Needs stability) | High (Wants upside) |

#### 3. The Package Modeling
Use [[biz/departments/hr/compensation/01-early-team-compensation|Early Team Compensation]] to calculate the offer constraints.
* **Cash Constraints:** Maximum burn Rp 7.5M. This is "Survival Ramen Profitability". It filters out those who are just looking for a job.
* **Equity Trade-off:** 20-30% Equity. This is a massive stake, usually reserved for co-founders. We offer this because we expect them to bring half the business value (Domain Knowledge + Distribution).

**Output:**
- **Internal Scorecard:** A list of non-negotiable traits (e.g., "Must have managed a P&L >Rp 500M/month").
- **Partner Pitch Deck:** A 5-slide vision deck that sells the *opportunity* of fixing the F&B industry, not just the *features* of the app.

## Stage 2: Scouting & Job Posting

**Objective:** Find the 1% of operators who are tired of the grind and want leverage (Tech).

### Why This Matters
Great operators are busy running businesses. They are not scrolling through LinkedIn Job Boards looking for "Sales Associate" roles. They are likely burnt out from the 14-hour days of restaurant operations and are looking for a way to use their expertise without the physical toll. We need to find them where they hang out, vent, or network.

### How to Execute: Step-by-Step

#### 1. Scouting Channels (The "Fishing Holes")
* **LinkedIn Search (Targeted limits):**
 * Keywords: "General Manager F&B", "Restaurant Consultant", "Operations Director", "Ex-Ismaya", "Ex-Union Group", "Owner".
 * Filter: Look for people who have recently left a role or have "Open to Work" but with a high-level background.
* **Communities & Forums:**
 * **Facebook Groups:** "F&B Community Indonesia", "Asosiasi Pengusaha Kuliner".
 * **WhatsApp Guilds:** Many F&B owners have private groups. Access these via your existing network.
* **Direct Network (The "Super-Connector" Strategy):**
 * Ask every Restaurant Owner you know: *"Who is the smartest General Manager you ever hired? The one who really ran the place like it was theirs?"*
 * Ask F&B Consultants: *"Who is the best operator you know who is tired of the daily grind?"*

#### 2. The "Letter" (Not a Job Description)
Do not write a standard JD with a list of bullets. Write a personal letter to a peer.

**Template: The Partner Pitch (Email/DM)**
```markdown
**Subject:** Partnering to fix F&B Operations (Not a job offer)

**Hi [Name],**

I've been following your work at [Restaurant/Group] and I saw your post about [Topic]. It resonated with me because I'm tackling that exact problem from a tech angle.

**The Context:**
I'm a Technical Founder building the "Operating System" for Indonesia's F&B industry. We have active users and revenue. The product works.

**The Problem:**
I can build the tool, but I haven't lived the life. I need a Partner who has run a P&L, managed a kitchen, and felt the pain of "Unknown Loss" firsthand.

**The Opportunity:**
I'm looking for a **Founding Partner (Ops & Growth)** to co-lead this company with me.
This is not a sales job.
This is a co-founder role with significant equity (20-30%).
Your job would be to tell me *what* to build (Product Strategy) and tell the market *why* they need it (Go-To-Market).

**The Ask:**
I can't match a GM's salary right now (we are early stage), but I can match the upside potential of owning the business.
If you're tired of the operational grind and want to build something scalable, let's grab coffee.

Best,
[Founder Name]
pwbi.id
```

## Stage 3: Resume & Portfolio Screening

**Objective:** Ruthlessly filter for "Evidence of Building" and "Operational Grit".

### Why This Matters
We are not looking for someone who "managed" a system that was already running perfectly. We are looking for someone who **fixed** a broken system or **built** a new one from scratch. Standard corporate resumes often hide this. We need to read between the lines.

### How to Execute: Step-by-Step

#### Signals to Look For (The Filter)
* ** "Failed" Restaurateur:** Someone who started their own cafe and failed is actually a *great* candidate. They know the pain of bankruptcy, cash flow, and marketing. They are hungry for redemption.
* ** The "Turnaround" Artist:** Look for bullets like "Took a failing outlet from -10% EBITDA to +15% in 6 months." This shows analytical problem solving.
* ** "Tech-Forward" Operator:** The GM who self-implemented a new POS, or built a complex Excel roster, or hacked together a Zapier automation. This shows they crave efficiency.
* ** Pure Corporate Lifer:** Someone who has only worked in massive 5-star hotels with huge support teams. They might struggle with the "Scrappy" nature of a startup where they have to be their own secretary/admin.
* ** Job Hopper (Short Stints):** If they move every 6 months, they likely lack the grit to stick through the "Valley of Death" phase of a startup.

**Action:** Shortlist max 5 candidates. Send them a personal note: *"I saw you ran [Restaurant X]. I loved that place. I'm building something to help owners like you."*

## Stage 4: Vision Call (The "Coffee Chat")

**Objective:** Validate Alignment. Do they "Get" the problem? Can we work together?

### Why This Matters
This is the first direct interaction. It's crucial to establish a peer-to-peer dynamic, pitch the upside, and quickly filter for cultural fit. We are testing for **Intellectual Honesty** and **Passion**.

### How to Execute: Step-by-Step
**Format:** 30-45 min video call. Informal but structured.

#### The Script (Voice Prompts)

**1. The Opening (Warm-up):**
> "Thanks for joining. To be clear, I'm not looking for an employee to command. I'm looking for a partner to debate with. I know the code, you know the kitchen. I want to see if combining those two creates magic."

**2. The Problem Probe (Testing Authority):**
> "Tell me about the biggest operational nightmare you faced running [Restaurant X]. Was it theft? Inventory? Staffing? Walk me through the pain."
* *Listen for:* Do they talk about specific numbers/details? Do they sound frustrated (good)? Do they blame others (bad)?

**3. The Product Roast (Testing Honesty):**
> "I'm going to share my screen and show you the Dashboard. I want you to be brutally honest. If you were a GM today, would you pay Rp 1M/month for this? Or is it useless?"
* *Pass:* "The inventory feature is useless because nobody counts stock daily. You need to automate the theoretical usage instead." (Insightful).
* *Fail:* "It looks really nice! I love the colors." (Superficial).

**4. The Financial Reality Check:**
> "We are cash poor, equity rich. We offer 'Survival Cash' (Rp 5-7.5M) but 'Founder Equity' (20-30%). Are you in a financial position to take that bet? I don't want to waste your time if you have a mortgage that requires a Rp 25M salary right now."

**Decision:** Proceed to Trial or Reject. If rejecting, provide brief, honest feedback.

---

## Stage 5: Assessment (The Paid Trial)

**Objective:** Work before Wedding. Validate skills in reality.
**Philosophy:** Resumes lie. Interviews are performance art. **Work is truth.**

### Why This Matters
Hiring a partner based solely on interviews is like buying a car without a test drive. The paid trial allows both parties to experience working together on a real problem. It reveals their communication style, speed of execution, and quality of thought.

### How to Execute: Step-by-Step

#### Design the Trial
* **Context:** Real work, not homework. Something that is on your backlog.
* **Duration:** Timeboxed to 10-15 hours to respect their time.
* **Compensation:** Paid (Rp 2-3M fixed fee). This filters out those not serious.

#### Trial Examples for "Founding Partner (Ops)"
**Task 1: The Product Strategy Audit (40%)**
* "Here is a login to our demo environment."
* "Spend 2 hours acting like a Manager of a 3-outlet cafe chain."
* "Record a Loom video (10 mins max) tearing the product apart. What workflow is unnatural? What feature is missing? What is confusing?"

**Task 2: The Go-To-Market Pitch (40%)**
* "Identify 5 restaurants in Jakarta that fit our Ideal Customer Profile."
* "Draft the exact WhatsApp message or Email you would send to the owner (assuming you know them slightly) to get them to try this product."
* "Explain *why* you chose that angle."

**Task 3: The Pricing Model (20%)**
* "Review our current pricing (Rp 25M Lifetime). Is this a blocker? How would you structure it to make it a 'No Brainer' for a cafe owner with Rp 500M revenue/year?"

#### Evaluation Rubric (Internal Scorecard)
1. **Insight:** Did they teach you something about the industry you didn't know? Did they spot a flaw you missed?
2. **Voice:** Did their outreach message sound like a "Sales Rep" (spammy/formal) or a "Peer" (credible/casual)?
3. **Clarity:** Can they translate "Kitchen Chaos" into logical "Software Requirements"?
4. **Speed:** Did they deliver on time? Did they ask good clarifying questions?

---

## Stage 6: Onsite / Strategy Session

**Objective:** The "Co-Founder Marriage" Test. Deep strategic alignment.

### Why This Matters
If the Trial goes well, we know they can *do* the work. Now we need to know if we can *live* with them. A co-founder relationship is intense. You need shared values and high trust.

### Agenda (Half Day - 4 Hours)

**1. The Roadmap War Room (2 Hours):**
* Print out the UI screens or use a whiteboard.
* **Scenario:** *"We have 6 weeks of runway left. We need to get 10 paying customers. What features do we cut? What do we build? What is the pitch?"*
* **Observe:** How do they prioritize? Are they ruthless? Do they panic? Do they defer to you or do they lead?

**2. The "Airport Test" (Dinner/Drinks):**
* Go for a meal. No laptops.
* **Topics:** Ambition ("Where do you want to be in 5 years?"), Money ("What does financial freedom look like to you?"), Life ("What do you do for fun?").
* **Question:** *"If our flight was delayed for 6 hours, would I be annoyed or would we have a good conversation?"*
* **Trust Gut:** If there is any hesitation, the answer is No.

## Stage 7: Reference Checks (Backchannel)

**Objective:** Project future behavior based on past patterns. Verify integrity.

### Why This Matters
People are consistent. Previous behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. We specifically need to know how they handle **adversity** and **ambiguity**.

### Protocol
* **Direct References:** Ask for 2 former bosses/partners.
* **Backchannel:** Find mutual connections (even loosely) on LinkedIn.

#### The Script (Phone Call, not Email)
> "Hi [Name], I'm considering partnering with [Candidate] for a co-founder role. I know they worked with you at [Company].
> I'm not looking for a generic 'good job' check. I need to know how to support them.
>
> 1. **The Pressure Test:** When things went wrong in the restaurant (e.g., bad review, staff walkout), how did they react? Did they panic or lead?
> 2. **The Ownership Test:** Did they treat the company money like their own?
> 3. **The 'Rehire' Question:** If you were starting a new business today with your own money, would you partner with them? (Listen for the pause)."

---

## Stage 8: The Offer

**Objective:** Close the Partner.

### The Pitch
> "I can build anything. But I don't know *what* to build to win this market. You do.
> You have the domain authority. I have the technical leverage.
> That's why I'm offering [X]% equity. This is your company as much as mine.
> Let's build the tool you wish you had when you were a GM."

### The Components
1. **Vesting Agreement:** Standard 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff. (Protects both of you).
2. **Role Title:** "Founding Partner (Ops & Growth)".
3. **Compensation:**
 * **Now:** "Survival Cash" (Rp 5-7.5M).
 * **Future:** Market Rate (Rp 25M+) triggers upon Series A or Rp 1B ARR.

---

## Onboarding (The First 90 Days)

**Objective:** Download their brain into the Product and get them to their first "Win".

#### Week 1: The Product Audit
* **Access:** Full admin access to everything (Stripe, Cloud, Code repo, Linear). Trust by default.
* **Task:** They don't sell yet. They break the product. They interview existing users.
* **Goal:** Compile a list of "The Top 10 Things to Fix before we sell."

#### Month 1: The "Founder-Led Sales" (Joint)
* **Activity:** You do demos together. They do the talking (Intro/Problem); You do the clicking (Demo); They close (Next Steps).
* **Goal:** Close 3 "Friendly" deals from their network to validate the pitch.

#### Month 3: The Handover
* **Ownership:** They take full ownership of the "Revenue Number".
* **Gatekeeper:** They become the 'Product Owner'—you stop building features unless they approve the spec.
* **Hiring:** They verify if we need to hire more support or sales staff (Phase 3 readiness).

---

## Tools & Tech Stack for Hiring
* **Sourcing:**
 * **LinkedIn Recruiter Lite:** Worth the $100/mo for 1 month to find specific profiles.
 * **Twitter Advanced Search:** Find people talking about "Restaurant Operations".
* **Assessment:**
 * **Loom:** Essential for async communication and "Audit" tasks.
 * **Notion:** Shared workspace for the Trial project.
* **Legal:**
 * **DocuSign:** For the Vesting Agreement.
 * **Founder's Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (RSPA):** The legal document for equity.

---

## Candidate Experience Policy
* **Transparency:** Be brutally honest about the risks (startups are hard, low cash, high equity).
* **Speed:** Move from First Chat to Trial Offer in <1 week. A-players lose interest fast.
* **Feedback:** If you reject someone after the Vision Call or Trial, give them 3 lines of specific feedback. They will appreciate it and might refer someone else.

**Rejection Template:**
> "Hi [Name], thanks for the time. While your experience is great, we felt that your approach to [Specific Problem] was a bit more 'Corporate/Process-heavy' than we need for this scrappy 0-to-1 phase. I've processed the payment for the trial. Let's stay in touch."
