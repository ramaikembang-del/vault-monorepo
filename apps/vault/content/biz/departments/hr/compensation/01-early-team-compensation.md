# Early-Stage Team Compensation Framework (2→3 Person Team)

**Date:** January 5, 2026
**Purpose:** Define sustainable compensation as company scales from 2-person founding team to 3-person team
**Context:** Based on Conservative (Rp 580.5M Y1) and Realistic (Rp 7.4B Y1) revenue scenarios
**Actual Team:** 2 co-founders from start (Field Ops & Product Development + Strategy & Technical Architecture)

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Recommendation:**
- **2-Person Founding Team (Month 1-9):** Rp 0-15M/month total + equity split TBD
- **3-Person Team (Month 9+):** Rp 25M/month total (2 founders + 1 hire) + equity

**Rationale:** Company breakeven is Month 9-10. Minimize burn pre-breakeven, scale compensation post-breakeven.

---

## Financial Capacity Analysis

### Conservative Scenario (Official Planning)

**Year 1 Revenue:** Rp 580.5M
**Year 1 Costs:** Rp 617.4M (team Rp 360M + infrastructure Rp 60M + marketing Rp 120M + variable Rp 77.4M)
**Year 1 Loss:** -Rp 106.4M (net after COGS)
**Breakeven:** Month 9-10 (cumulative cash flow positive)

**Revenue Ramp:**
- Months 1-3: ~Rp 30-50M/month (slow start, building pipeline)
- Months 4-6: ~Rp 50-80M/month (A1 sales picking up, E1 freemium growing)
- Months 7-9: ~Rp 80-120M/month (approaching breakeven)
- Months 10-12: ~Rp 120-150M/month (profitable, cash flow positive)

**Team Budget Capacity:**
- Months 1-6: Rp 0-15M/month (survive on savings, minimal burn)
- Months 7-9: Rp 15-25M/month (approaching breakeven, can afford 2-person team)
- Months 10-12: Rp 25-35M/month (profitable, can afford 3-person team)

---

### Realistic Scenario (Aggressive Execution)

**Year 1 Revenue:** Rp 7.4B
**Team Budget Capacity:** Rp 50-80M/month (10-fold Conservative capacity)
**Justification:** If hitting Realistic by Month 3-6, scale team faster

---

## Compensation Framework by Stage

### Stage 1: 2-Person Founding Team (Month 1-9)

**Team Structure:**
- **Partner 1 (Field Ops & Product Development):** Builds base models, practical implementation, field operations
- **Partner 2 (Strategy & Technical Architecture):** Repository/planning, builds on base models, strategic architecture

**Compensation:**
- **Total Cash Salary:** **Rp 0-15M/month** (split TBD by partners)
 - Month 1-3: Rp 0-5M total (survive on savings, pre-revenue)
 - Month 4-6: Rp 5-10M total (minimal living expenses, post-first-revenue)
 - Month 7-9: Rp 10-15M total (approaching breakeven)
- **Equity:** Split by co-founder agreement (to be documented separately)
- **Total Annual:** Rp 60-120M cash max

**Rationale:**
- 2-person capacity from start (vs solo founder limits)
- Pre-revenue/low revenue = minimal cash extraction
- Equity is primary compensation
- **Focus:** Validate product-market fit with 2× execution capacity

**Revenue Capacity:**
- Months 1-3: Rp 30-50M revenue → Rp 5M salary = 10-17% payroll ratio
- Months 4-6: Rp 50-80M revenue → Rp 10M salary = 13-20% payroll ratio
- Months 7-9: Rp 80-120M revenue → Rp 15M salary = 13-19% payroll ratio

**Gate to Stage 2:**
- Rp 100M+ monthly revenue consistent (Month 9)
- 50+ A1 customers + 200+ E1 freemium users
- Clear PMF signal (20%+ E1 conversion, 30%+ R1 upsell)
- Breakeven achieved

---

### Stage 2: 3-Person Team (Month 9+)

**Team Structure:** **2 Founding Partners + Hire 1 (Product/Marketing or Tech specialist)**

#### Your Compensation (Founder)
- **Cash Salary:** **Rp 10M/month** (Rp 120M/year)
- **Equity:** 70-80% (dilute 20-30% for first hire)
- **Total:** Rp 120M cash + majority equity

**Rationale:**
- Rp 10M = Reasonable founder salary (below market Rp 15-20M, but sustainable)
- Still below-market to preserve cash
- 70-80% equity = founder still has control + upside

**Your Responsibilities (Biz/Tech 50/50):**
- **Biz (50%):** A1 partner sales, R1 upsell conversations, strategic planning, fundraising prep
- **Tech (50%):** E1 Electron app development, A1 Power BI template updates, R1 automation scripts, infrastructure

**Why This Split Works for You:**
- You have technical background → Can build E1 MVP + maintain A1 template
- Frees Hire 1 to focus on product vision + growth marketing (your weaker areas)
- Biz/Tech combo = founder stays close to product + customers

#### Hire 1 Compensation (Product + Marketing)

**Profile:** Product manager with growth marketing skills (or growth marketer with product sense)

**Cash Salary:** **Rp 5-7.5M/month** (Rp 60-90M/year)
**Equity:** 20-30% vesting over 4 years (1-year cliff)
**Total:** Rp 60-90M cash + 20-30% equity stake

**Indonesian Market Rates (Jakarta, 2025):**
- Junior Product Manager: Rp 6-10M/month
- Junior Growth Marketer: Rp 5-8M/month
- **Offering Rp 5-7.5M = Below market** → Equity compensates

**Hire 1 Responsibilities (Product/Marketing 60/40):**
- **Product (60%):** E1 feature prioritization, A1 tier design, R1 onboarding flow, user research, roadmap
- **Marketing (40%):** Run WhatsApp/Instagram ads (Rp 7M budget), content creation, E1 viral loop design, analytics

**Why This Works:**
- Total team cost: Rp 15-17.5M/month (Rp 180-210M/year)
- vs Conservative budget: Rp 30M/month total budget (50-58% utilization)
- Preserves Rp 13-15M/month for infrastructure + marketing

**Alternative Profile Options:**
1. **Product-focused:** PM with marketing side skills (better for complex E1 product decisions)
2. **Marketing-focused:** Growth marketer with product intuition (better for rapid E1 user acquisition)
3. **Generalist:** Startup operator who can do both (hardest to find, but most valuable)

**Gate to Stage 3:**
- Month 9-10 cumulative breakeven achieved
- Rp 100M+ monthly revenue sustained
- 100+ A1 customers, 500+ E1 freemium, 30+ R1 subscribers
- Clear product-market fit signals (E1 20%+ conversion, R1 50%+ upsell)

---

### Stage 3: 3-Person Team (Month 9-12+)

**Team Structure:** **Founding Team (Biz + Product) + Hire 1 (Tech) + Hire 2 (Marketing)**

#### Your Compensation (Founder)
- **Cash Salary:** **Rp 10M/month** (Rp 120M/year) - **unchanged**
- **Equity:** 65-75% (diluted from 70-80% by Hire 2)
- **Total:** Rp 120M cash + majority equity

**Rationale:** Keep founder salary stable, increase ownership value through growth

#### Hire 1 Compensation (Tech - Specialized)

**Profile:** Full-time developer (Tech only, drops marketing duties)
**Team Structure:** **Founding Team (Biz + Tech lead) + Hire 1 (Product + Marketing) + Hire 2 (Tech specialist)**

#### Your Compensation (Founder)
- **Cash:** Rp 10M/month - **unchanged from Stage 2**
- **Equity:** 65-75% (diluted by Hire 2)

#### Hire 1 Compensation (Product/Marketing - Unchanged)
- **Cash:** Rp 7.5-10M/month (raised from Rp 5-7.5M for proven performance)
- **Equity:** 15-20% (same stake, now partially vested)
- **Rationale:** Raise rewards performance + allows full focus on product vision (drops some marketing execution to Hire 2)

#### Hire 2 Compensation (Tech Specialist)
- **Cash:** Rp 7.5-10M/month
- **Equity:** 10-15% vesting over 4 years (1-year cliff)

**Indonesian Market Rates:**
- Junior Full-Stack Dev: Rp 5-8M/month
- Mid-Level Full-Stack Dev: Rp 8-12M/month
- **Offering Rp 7.5-10M = Market competitive** with equity upside

**Total Team Cost:** Rp 25-30M/month

**Why This Works:**
- Post-breakeven = cash flow positive
- Rp 25M/month = 20-25% of Rp 100-120M/month revenue
- Specialist roles allow deeper focus

**Responsibilities:**
- **Founding Team (Biz/Tech Lead):** Strategic biz dev (A1 partnerships, fundraising), technical architecture, team leadership
- **Hire 1 (Product/Marketing):** Full product ownership (E1 roadmap, A1 tier design, R1 onboarding), marketing strategy (Hire 2 executes)
- **Hire 2 (Tech Specialist):** Full-time E1 development, infrastructure scaling, R1 automation, technical execution

**Why This Split Works:**
- You transition from hands-on tech → tech leadership + biz focus
- Hire 1 owns product vision + marketing strategy (proven performer)
- Hire 2 takes over execution work you were doing (frees your time for strategic work)

---

### Alternative: Stage 3 (Option B) - Generalist Team

**Team Structure:** **Founding Team (Biz/Tech/Mkt generalist) + Hire 1 (Tech/Product) + Hire 2 (Product/Mkt)**

This structure uses **generalists** instead of specialists, where everyone wears multiple hats.

#### Your Compensation (Founder)
- **Cash:** Rp 10M/month - **unchanged**
- **Equity:** 65-75%

**Your Responsibilities (Biz/Tech/Mkt 40/40/20):**
- **Biz (40%):** A1 partner sales, fundraising, strategic planning
- **Tech (40%):** Technical architecture, code review, infrastructure decisions
- **Marketing (20%):** Marketing strategy, budget allocation, partner marketing

#### Hire 1 Compensation (Tech/Product 60/40)
- **Cash:** Rp 7.5-10M/month
- **Equity:** 15-20%

**Hire 1 Responsibilities:**
- **Tech (60%):** E1 development, A1 template maintenance, R1 automation, infrastructure
- **Product (40%):** E1 feature prioritization, technical product decisions, user research

#### Hire 2 Compensation (Product/Mkt 60/40)
- **Cash:** Rp 7.5-10M/month
- **Equity:** 10-15%

**Hire 2 Responsibilities:**
- **Product (60%):** Product roadmap, A1 tier design, R1 onboarding flow, analytics
- **Marketing (40%):** WhatsApp/Instagram ads execution, content creation, viral loops

**Total Team Cost:** Rp 25-30M/month (same as Option A)

---

### Comparison: Specialist (Option A) vs Generalist (Option B)

| Factor | **Option A: Specialists** | **Option B: Generalists** |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Team** | You (Biz/Tech) + Prod/Mkt + Tech | You (Biz/Tech/Mkt) + Tech/Prod + Prod/Mkt |
| **Depth** | Deep expertise in each area | Broader coverage, less depth |
| **Flexibility** | Lower (each person owns domain) | Higher (can swap tasks easily) |
| **Hiring** | Easier (clear role definitions) | Harder (need multi-skilled people) |
| **Scalability** | Better (clear handoffs as team grows) | Worse (generalists harder to replace) |
| **Redundancy** | Lower (single point of failure per domain) | Higher (overlap in skills) |
| **Best For** | Clear product-market fit, scaling phase | Early stage, uncertain direction |

**Recommendation:**
- **Month 9-12 (early Stage 3):** Use **Option B (Generalists)** if still validating PMF
- **Month 12+ (scaling):** Transition to **Option A (Specialists)** as you scale

**Why Generalists First:**
- More flexibility when pivoting (E1 features, A1 pricing, R1 onboarding)
- Better coverage during sick days / vacations
- Easier to redistribute work as priorities shift

**Why Specialists Later:**
- Deeper expertise as product matures
- Clearer accountability (one owner per domain)
- Easier to hire additional specialists (Tech 2, Marketing 2, etc.)

## Compensation Summary Table

| Stage | Team | Your Salary | Hire Salaries | Total Monthly | Total Annual | Your Equity | Team Equity |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Solo** | 1 person | Rp 0-5M | - | **Rp 0-5M** | **Rp 0-60M** | 100% | - |
| **2-Person** | You (Biz/Tech) + Hire 1 (Prod/Mkt) | Rp 10M | Rp 5-7.5M | **Rp 15-17.5M** | **Rp 180-210M** | 70-80% | 20-30% |
| **3-Person** | You + Prod/Mkt + Tech | Rp 10M | Rp 7.5M + Rp 7.5M | **Rp 25M** | **Rp 300M** | 65-75% | 25-35% |

---

## Equity Allocation Framework

### Solo → 2-Person (First Hire)

**Founder (You):** 70-80%
**Hire 1 (Product/Marketing):** 20-30% (vesting over 4 years, 1-year cliff)

**Rationale:**
- First hire takes significant risk (no revenue, unproven business)
- 20-30% compensates for below-market salary
- 1-year cliff protects founder (if hire leaves early, equity reverts)
- Product/Marketing combo is harder to find than pure tech → Justifies higher equity

**Vesting Schedule:**
- Year 1 cliff: 0% (hire must stay 1 year to get any equity)
- Year 2: 25% vested (hit Month 12 = 25% unlocked)
- Year 3: 50% vested
- Year 4: 100% vested

---

### 2-Person → 3-Person (Second Hire)

**Founder (You):** 65-75% (diluted from 70-80%)
**Hire 1 (Product/Marketing):** 15-20% (diluted from 20-30%)
**Hire 2 (Tech Specialist):** 10-15%

**Rationale:**
- Second hire (Tech) joins post-breakeven (lower risk than Hire 1)
- Gets smaller equity (10-15% vs 20-30%) but higher cash (Rp 7.5-10M vs Rp 5-7.5M)
- Founder still retains 65-75% majority control
- Tech specialist easier to find than Product/Marketing hybrid → Lower equity justified

**Alternative (Equity Pool):**
- Set aside 30-35% equity pool for first 3 hires
- Hire 1: 15-20% of company
- Hire 2: 10-12% of company
- Future Hire 3: 5-8% of company (buffer for CS/Sales hire Year 2)

---

## Scenario-Based Adjustments

### If Tracking Conservative (Baseline)

**Stick to framework above:**
- Month 1-6: Rp 0-5M solo
- Month 6-9: Rp 15-17.5M for 2-person team
- Month 9-12: Rp 25M for 3-person team

**Total Year 1 Payroll:** Rp 180-240M (vs Rp 360M budget = 50-67% utilization)

---

### If Tracking Realistic (Aggressive Upside)

**Accelerate hiring + increase comp:**

**Month 3-6:** If hitting Rp 200M+/month revenue:
- Your salary: Rp 15M/month (vs Rp 5M)
- Hire 1 sooner (Month 4 vs Month 6)
- Hire 1 salary: Rp 10M/month (vs Rp 5-7.5M)

**Month 6-9:** If hitting Rp 600M+/month revenue:
- Add Hire 2 sooner (Month 7 vs Month 9)
- Total team: Rp 35-40M/month (you Rp 15M + Hire 1 Rp 12M + Hire 2 Rp 10M)

**Month 9-12:** If hitting Rp 1B+/month revenue:
- Scale to 5-person team (add CS + Sales)
- Total payroll: Rp 50-60M/month

**Rationale:** Realistic scenario = Rp 7.4B Year 1 = Rp 617M/month avg. Can afford Rp 50-60M payroll (8-10% ratio)

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Founder Frugality (Month 1-9)

**Your salary stays LOW (Rp 0-10M) until breakeven:**
- Preserves cash for marketing + infrastructure
- Signals commitment to team ("I'm not extracting, we're building together")
- Equity is your compensation (Rp 200B+ potential)

**DON'T:** Pay yourself Rp 20M/month Month 1 → Burns Rp 240M/year → Company dies

---

### 2. Below-Market Cash + Above-Market Equity

**Early hires get:**
- 60-80% market cash (Rp 5-10M vs market Rp 8-15M)
- 10-30% equity (worth Rp 20B-60B if Realistic, Rp 60B-200B if Aggressive)

**Math for Hire 1:**
- Cash sacrifice: Rp 3-5M/month × 12 = Rp 36-60M/year opportunity cost
- Equity potential (Realistic): 20% × Rp 68B = **Rp 13.6B** (227× cash sacrifice)
- **Clear value prop for early team**

---

### 3. Cliff Protections

**1-year cliff for all equity:**
- Hire must stay 12 months to vest ANY equity
- Protects founder from mercenary hires
- Standard in startups globally

**Milestone-based vesting (optional):**
- 25% vests on Month 12
- 25% vests on hitting Rp 1B ARR
- 25% vests on profitability
- 25% vests on Year 4
- **Aligns incentives with outcomes**

---

### 4. Breakeven-Driven Scaling

**Before Breakeven (Month 1-9):**
- Minimize cash burn
- Skeleton team (1-2 people max)
- Founder takes minimal/zero salary

**After Breakeven (Month 9+):**
- Scale team with revenue
- Increase salaries to market
- Hire specialists (Tech, Marketing separate)

**Rationale:** Don't hire beyond revenue capacity → Cash flow death spiral

---

## Comparison: Your Framework vs Conservative Budget

### Conservative Budget (from 08b)

**Team: Rp 30M/month × 12 = Rp 360M/year**
- 2 Developers @ Rp 10M = Rp 20M
- 1 CS @ Rp 6M
- 1 Sales/Marketing @ Rp 4M

**Issues with this:**
- Assumes 4-person team from Month 1 (unrealistic)
- Rp 360M payroll but only Rp 580M revenue = 62% payroll ratio (too high)
- Doesn't account for founder needing to eat

---

### Recommended Framework (Phased)

**Average Year 1 Payroll: Rp 210M**
- Month 1-6 Solo: Rp 30M (Rp 5M × 6)
- Month 6-9 2-Person: Rp 52.5M (Rp 17.5M × 3)
- Month 9-12 3-Person: Rp 100M (Rp 25M × 4)
- **Total: Rp 182.5M**

**Payroll Ratio:**
- Conservative revenue Rp 580.5M / Rp 210M payroll = **36% ratio** (sustainable)
- vs 08b model: Rp 580.5M / Rp 360M = 62% ratio (too high)

**Savings:** Rp 150M/year → Reinvest in marketing (unlock Realistic scenario)

---

## When to Raise Salary (Milestones)

### Your Salary Progression

| Milestone | Your Salary | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Month 1-3** | Rp 0 | Pre-revenue, survive on savings |
| **Month 4-6** | Rp 5M | First revenue, minimal living |
| **Month 7-9** | Rp 10M | Approaching breakeven, 2-person team formed |
| **Month 10-12** | Rp 10M | Post-breakeven, keep stable (growth = equity value) |
| **Year 2 (if Realistic)** | Rp 15-20M | Company profitable, hitting Rp 1B+ ARR |
| **Year 3 (if Aggressive)** | Rp 25-30M | Unicorn trajectory, still below market for CEO |

**Principle:** Your salary tracks profitability, NOT revenue. Growth value accrues to equity.

---

### Team Salary Progression

| Milestone | Hire 1 Salary | Hire 2 Salary | Total Team |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **Month 6-9** | Rp 5-7.5M | - | Rp 15-17.5M |
| **Month 10-12** | Rp 7.5-10M | Rp 7.5-10M | Rp 25-30M |
| **Year 2 (Realistic)** | Rp 12-15M | Rp 12-15M | Rp 40-50M (+ Hire 3-4) |
| **Year 3 (Aggressive)** | Rp 15-20M | Rp 15-20M | Rp 60-80M (5-8 person team) |

**Principle:** Salaries grow with profitability + team tenure. Early hires earn raises through equity vesting + cash increases.

---

## Equity Value Illustration

### Hire 1 (20% equity stake)

**Conservative Outcome (Rp 2.9B Year 3 ARR):**
- Valuation @ 5× ARR = Rp 14.5B
- Hire 1 stake: 20% × Rp 14.5B = **Rp 2.9B** (~USD $180K)
- **Still life-changing in Indonesia**

**Realistic Outcome (Rp 68B Year 3 ARR):**
- Valuation @ 8× ARR = Rp 544B
- Hire 1 stake: 20% × Rp 544B = **Rp 108.8B** (~USD $6.8M)
- **Hire 1 is wealthy**

**Aggressive Outcome (Rp 204B Year 3 ARR):**
- Valuation @ 10× ARR = Rp 2,040B (Rp 2 Trillion)
- Hire 1 stake: 20% × Rp 2T = **Rp 400B** (~USD $25M)
- **Hire 1 is VERY wealthy**

**Takeaway:** Equity compensates for below-market salary 100-1000× over

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Month 1-6 (Solo, Validate)

**Your Salary:** Rp 0-5M/month
**Focus:** Build A1, E1 MVP, validate PMF, hit Rp 50M/month revenue
**Funding:** Personal savings + first revenue

**Decision Point (Month 6):**
- If Rp 50M+ revenue sustained → Hire 1
- If <Rp 30M revenue → Stay solo, reduce burn to Rp 0/month

---

### Month 6-9 (2-Person, Scale)

**Team:** You (Rp 10M) + Hire 1 Tech/Mkt (Rp 5-7.5M) = **Rp 15-17.5M/month**
**Focus:** Scale E1 freemium, A1 partner sales, R1 auto-enrollment
**Target:** Hit Rp 100M/month revenue by Month 9

**Decision Point (Month 9):**
- If Rp 100M+ revenue + breakeven → Hire 2
- If Rp 60-100M revenue → Delay Hire 2 to Month 12
- If <Rp 60M revenue → Freeze hiring, fix conversion/retention issues

---

### Month 9-12 (3-Person, Optimize)

**Team:** You (Rp 10M) + Tech (Rp 7.5M) + Marketing (Rp 7.5M) = **Rp 25M/month**
**Focus:** E1 viral loops (K=1.0), A1 partner incentives, R1 50% conversion
**Target:** Hit Rp 150M/month revenue, end year profitable

**End of Year 1:**
- Total payroll: Rp 210M
- Revenue (Conservative): Rp 580.5M (36% payroll ratio )
- Revenue (Realistic): Rp 7.4B (2.8% payroll ratio )

---

## Final Recommendations

### What You Should Pay Yourself

**My Recommendation:**
1. **Month 1-6:** **Rp 0-3M/month** (absolute minimum, survive on savings)
2. **Month 7-9:** **Rp 10M/month** (reasonable founder salary post-first-hires)
3. **Month 10-12:** **Rp 10M/month** (stay flat, growth value → equity)
4. **Year 2 (if profitable):** **Rp 15M/month** (reward for hitting profitability)

**Total Year 1:** Rp 90-120M (~USD $5,600-7,500/year)
**This is:** Below minimum wage in many countries, but **aligned with Indonesian early-stage founder reality**

**Your equity value (Realistic):** 70% × Rp 544B = **Rp 380B** (~USD $24M)
**Compensation is equity growth, not cash extraction**

---

### 2-Person Team Allocation

**You:** Rp 10M/month + 70-80% equity
**Hire 1:** Rp 5-7.5M/month + 20-30% equity
**Total:** **Rp 15-17.5M/month** (conservative, sustainable)

**Timing:** Hire Month 6-7 (post-PMF validation, pre-breakeven)

---

### 3-Person Team Allocation

**You:** Rp 10M/month + 65-75% equity
**Hire 1 (Tech):** Rp 7.5-10M/month + 15-20% equity
**Hire 2 (Marketing):** Rp 7.5-10M/month + 10-15% equity
**Total:** **Rp 25-30M/month** (post-breakeven, profit-funded)

**Timing:** Hire 2 at Month 9-10 (post-breakeven, cash flow positive)

---

## Bottom Line

**You should pay yourself:**
- **Months 1-6:** Rp 0-5M/month (solo, validate)
- **Months 7-12:** Rp 10M/month (with team, growing)

**2-person team:** Rp 15-17.5M/month total
**3-person team:** Rp 25M/month total

**This preserves Rp 150M/year vs Conservative budget** → Reinvest in marketing → Unlock Realistic scenario (Rp 68B) → Your 70% = **Rp 47.6B** (~USD $3M)

**Founder frugality Year 1 = Life-changing wealth Year 3-5.**

---

**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Next Step:** Formalize equity vesting agreements before Hire 1
**Document to Create:** Founders' Agreement + ESOP Plan
