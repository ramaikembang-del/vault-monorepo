## Feedback Triage Process

### Step 1: Collect
- All feedback → Notion database (centralized)
- Tag with: Source, Priority, Category

### Step 2: Categorize
**Bug:** Something broken (route to Engineering)  
**Feature Request:** New functionality (route to Product)  
**Complaint:** Poor experience (route to CS for resolution)  
**Praise:** Positive feedback (celebrate!)

### Step 3: Prioritize
**Impact:** How many users affected?  
**Effort:** How hard to fix?  
**Strategic Fit:** Aligns with roadmap?

**Priority Matrix:**
- High Impact + Low Effort = DO NOW
- High Impact + High Effort = PLAN (roadmap)
- Low Impact + Low Effort = NICE-TO-HAVE (backlog)
- Low Impact + High Effort = DON'T DO

### Step 4: Act
- **Bugs:** Fix within SLA (P0-P3)
- **Features:** Add to roadmap (if high priority)
- **Complaints:** CS resolves + prevents recurrence

### Step 5: Close Loop
- Notify customer (what we did)
- "Thanks for feedback! We fixed X / Added to roadmap"
