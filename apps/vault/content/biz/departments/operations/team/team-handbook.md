## Core Values

### 1. Customer Obsession

### 2. Radical Transparency
- Default to open (share information broadly)
- Admit mistakes quickly
- No hidden agendas

### 3. Move Fast, Learn Faster
- Ship early, iterate based on data
- Fail small, not big (test before scaling)
- 70% certainty is enough to decide

### 4. Excellence Without Ego
- High standards for work quality
- Zero tolerance for arrogance
- Help teammates succeed
