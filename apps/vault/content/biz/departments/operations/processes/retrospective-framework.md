# Retrospective Framework
**Learn & Improve After Sprints/Projects**

**Owner:** Product + Operations  
**Status:** ACTIVE

## Purpose

**Retrospectives = structured reflection to improve**

After every sprint/project, ask:
1. What went well?
2. What went badly?
3. What will we do differently next time?

---

## When to Retro

**Cadence:**
- **Sprint retro:** Every 4 weeks (end of sprint)
- **Project retro:** After major launches
- **Incident retro:** After outages/crises

**Who Attends:**
- Entire team (for sprint retros)
- Project stakeholders only (for project retros)

---

## Retro Format (60 min)

### Phase 1: Data Gathering (20 min)
**Activity:** Silent brainstorming (sticky notes)
- Green: What went well?
- Red: What went badly?
- Blue: Questions/confusions

### Phase 2: Group & Discuss (20 min)
- Cluster similar notes
- Vote on top 3 topics to discuss
- Discuss root causes (not blame)

### Phase 3: Action Items (20 min)
- Define 2-3 concrete improvements
- Assign owners + deadlines
- Document in retro log

## Retro Anti-Patterns (Avoid!)

❌ **Blame game:** "This failed because [person] didn't..."  
✅ **System thinking:** "Our process didn't catch this - how do we prevent?"

❌ **No action items:** Just venting, no follow-up  
✅ **Committed actions:** "By next sprint, we will [X]"

❌ **Same issues every retro:** Not learning  
✅ **Track improvements:** "Issue Y fixed after last retro, celebrating!"

## Example Retro Insights

**Sprint 1 Retro (January 2026):**
- ✅ **Went well:** Launched on time, hit revenue target
- ❌ **Went badly:** Communication gaps (sales didn't know about feature changes)
- 🔧 **Action:** Weekly sync between Product & Sales (15 min standup)
