# Action Item Tracking
**Meeting Follow-Ups & Accountability**

**Owner:** Operations  
**Status:** ACTIVE

## Why Track Action Items?

**Problem:** Meetings generate tasks, but without tracking:
- Tasks get forgotten
- Unclear ownership
- No accountability

**Solution:** Systematic action item tracking

---

## Action Item Format

**Every action item must have:**
1. **What:** Clear task description
2. **Who:** Single owner (names, not "team")
3. **When:** Deadline (specific date)
4. **Status:** Not Started / In Progress / Done / Blocked

**Example:**
- What: "Update pricing page with Tier 2 info"
- Who: Marketing Lead
- When: Jan 15
- Status: In Progress

---

## Tracking System

**Tool:** Notion database

**Columns:**
- Task
- Owner
- Deadline
- Status
- Meeting Source (which meeting generated this?)
- Priority (P0/P1/P2)

**Views:**
- By Owner (see all your tasks)
- By Deadline (what's due this week?)
- By Status (what's blocked?)

---

## Meeting Process

### During Meeting
1. Assign action items as they arise
2. Clarify owner + deadline immediately
3. Meeting notes-taker logs in database

### After Meeting
1. Meeting notes shared (within 2 hours)
2. Action items listed at bottom
3. Each owner confirms (thumbs up in Slack)

## Weekly Review

**Monday Standup:**
- Review overdue items (why late?)
- Check this week's deadlines
- Flag blockers (need help?)

**Friday Wrap-Up:**
- Close completed items
- Push deadlines if needed (with reason)
- Celebrate wins!

---

## Accountability

**Overdue Items:**
- Auto-reminder (Notion automation or Slack bot)
- Escalate if 7+ days overdue (to manager)

**Chronic Late:**
- 1-on-1 discussion (is capacity issue? prioritization?)
- Adjust workload or processes

---

## Best Practices

**Assign During Meeting (Not After):**
- Don't leave with vague "someone should do X"
- Get commitment in real-time

**Small Tasks Only:**
- Action items = <2 hours work
- Larger = Create project/ticket instead

**Close Loop:**
- Mark "Done" + share outcome
- "Updated pricing page: [link]"

---

## Example Workflow

**Meeting:** Weekly Planning  
**Action Item Generated:** "Research competitor pricing"

**Logged:**
- Task: Research Moka, Pawoon analytics pricing
- Owner: Product Lead
- Deadline: Jan 12
- Status: Not Started

**Week Later:**
- Owner researches, finds Moka charges Rp 200K/month
- Updates database: Status → Done
- Shares findings in Slack: "Moka pricing research: [doc link]"
