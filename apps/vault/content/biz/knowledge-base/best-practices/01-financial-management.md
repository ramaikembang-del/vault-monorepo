## Daily Financial Discipline

**Review These Metrics Daily:**
1. **Cash on hand** - Opening + sales - expenses
2. **Sales vs target** - Are you on track?
3. **Top-selling items** - What's moving?
4. **Wastage** - Food thrown away today

**PWBI Tip:** Use E1 Dashboard "Daily Summary" widget for at-a-glance view.

## Weekly Financial Review

**Every Monday Morning:**
1. **Last week's P&L** - Profit vs target
2. **Cash flow** - Did you have enough cash?
3. **Top 10 items** - Menu optimization opportunities
4. **Staff costs %** - Should be <30% of revenue

**Action Items:**
- Adjust menu based on top sellers
- Address slow-moving inventory
- Review staffing levels

## Monthly Must-Dos

### 1. Full P&L Review

**Key Ratios to Track:**
- **Gross Profit Margin:** (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
 - Target: 60-70% for restaurants, 70-80% for cafes
- **Prime Cost:** COGS + Labor
 - Target: <60% of revenue
- **Net Profit Margin:** Net profit / Revenue
 - Target: 10-15% (healthy F&B business)

**PWBI Tip:** Use R2a Simple P&L module for automatic calculations.

### 2. Cash Flow Management

**Rule of Thumb:** Maintain 2-3 months operating expenses in cash reserve.

**Cash Flow Killers:**
- Over-ordering inventory
- Slow customer payments (for catering)
- Uncontrolled spending

**PWBI Tip:** R2b Cash Flow module shows cash runway forecast.

### 3. COGS Control

**Best Practices:**
- **Weekly inventory count** - Catch theft/wastage early
- **Recipe costing** - Know exact cost per dish
- **Supplier comparison** - Get 3 quotes for major ingredients
- **Portion control** - Train staff on standard portions

**Target COGS:**
- Quick service: 25-30%
- Casual dining: 28-32%
- Fine dining: 30-35%
- Cafes: 20-25%

**PWBI Tip:** R2c COGS Calculator tracks recipe costs automatically.

---

## Pricing Strategy

**Cost-Plus Method:**
```
Selling Price = COGS / Target Food Cost %
Example: COGS Rp 20K, target 30% = Rp 20K / 0.30 = Rp 66.7K
```

**Don't Forget:**
- Add VAT (PPN 11% in Indonesia)
- Round to psychologically appealing prices (Rp 69K not Rp 67K)
- Test price sensitivity with A/B testing

---

## Budgeting Tips

**Create Monthly Budget By:**
1. **Revenue:** Based on last year + growth target
2. **Variable costs:** COGS (% of revenue), supplies
3. **Fixed costs:** Rent, salaries, utilities
4. **Target profit:** What's left after costs

**Review Budget vs Actual Weekly:** Catch problems early.

## Indonesian F&B Specific

**Tax Compliance:**
- **PPN (VAT):** 11% on all sales (report monthly)
- **PPh (Income Tax):** 0.5-1% of gross revenue (for SMEs)
- **Employee taxes:** PPh 21 (withholding)

**Keep Records:**
- All receipts (10 years for tax compliance)
- Daily cash register report (Z-report)
- Bank statements
- Supplier invoices

**PWBI helps:** Automatic PPN calculation in all reports.

## Common Financial Mistakes

** Avoid:**
1. **Mixing personal and business money** - Separate accounts!
2. **No financial tracking** - "I'll remember" doesn't work
3. **Underpricing** - Know your true costs
4. **Over-expansion** - Grow when profitable, not before
5. **Ignoring small leaks** - Rp 10K/day wastage = Rp 3.6M/year

** Do:**
1. **Review financials weekly** - Early warning system
2. **Build cash reserves** - For slow months
3. **Track everything** - Sales, costs, inventory
4. **Set targets** - And measure against them
5. **Get help** - Accountant for taxes, PWBI for analytics
