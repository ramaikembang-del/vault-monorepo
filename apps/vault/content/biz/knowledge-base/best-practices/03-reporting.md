## Metrics That Matter

**Don't Track Everything - Track What Matters!**

### Daily Metrics (Check Every Morning)
1. **Yesterday's Sales** - vs same day last week
2. **Average Transaction Value** - Rp per customer
3. **Transaction Count** - Number of customers
4. **Top 5 Items Sold** - What's popular?

### Weekly Metrics
1. **Week-over-week sales growth** - Are you growing?
2. **Prime cost %** - (COGS + Labor) / Revenue
3. **Wastage %** - Food thrown away / Total food purchased
4. **Peak hours** - When are you busiest?

### Monthly Metrics
1. **Revenue vs budget**
2. **Gross profit margin**
3. **Customer retention** - Returning customers %
4. **Menu item profitability** - Profit per item

**PWBI Tip:** Pin your key metrics to "Favorites" for quick access.

## Dashboard Design Tips

**Good Dashboard = Answers Questions at a Glance**

**Do's:**
- **One question per visualization** - Don't cram too much
- **Use comparisons** - This week vs last week, actual vs target
- **Highlight exceptions** - Red for below target, green for above
- **Keep it simple** - 5-7 widgets max per dashboard

**Don'ts:**
- **Too many colors** - Stick to 2-3 colors
- **3D charts** - Harder to read, not more insightful
- **Cluttered** - White space is good!

## Report Scheduling

**Automate Your Reporting:**

**Daily Reports (7am delivery):**
- Sales summary (yesterday)
- Top items sold
- Cash vs expected (for cash businesses)

**Weekly Reports (Monday 8am):**
- Week summary with week-over-week comparison
- Staff performance
- Inventory alerts (low stock)

**Monthly Reports (1st of month):**
- Full P&L
- Cash flow statement
- Menu item profitability analysis
- Customer analytics (new vs returning)

**PWBI**: Settings → Reports → Schedule

## Data Filters Best Practices

**Use Filters to Dig Deeper:**

**Date Filters:**
- **Last 7 days** - Spot short-term trends
- **Last 30 days** - Monthly performance
- **Last 12 months** - Seasonality patterns
- **Custom range** - Compare specific periods (Ramadan vs non-Ramadan)

**Segment Filters:**
- By outlet (multi-location)
- By category (Beverages vs Food)
- By payment method (Cash vs Card vs E-wallet)
- By time (Breakfast vs Lunch vs Dinner)

**Pro Tip:** Save commonly used filter combinations as "Saved Views".

## Insight Generation

**From Data to Action:**

### Example 1: Low Transaction Count
**Data:** Transaction count down 15% vs last month
**Question:** Why fewer customers?
**Dig deeper:**
- Check by day of week - Which days dropped?
- Check by time - Breakfast, lunch, or dinner?
- External factors - Construction nearby? Competitor opened?

**Action:**
- Promotion targeting slow days/times
- Delivery partnership if foot traffic down

### Example 2: High COGS
**Data:** Food cost % jumped from 30% to 35%
**Question:** Where's the waste/theft?
**Dig deeper:**
- Check by item - Which items have highest COGS?
- Inventory count - Missing stock?
- Recipe portions - Staff using too much?

**Action:**
- Renegotiate with supplier (or switch)
- Implement portion control training
- Weekly inventory counts

## Common Reporting Mistakes

** Mistake 1: "Vanity Metrics"**
- Tracking total revenue without profit
- **Fix:** Always look at profit margin, not just revenue

** Mistake 2: "No Benchmarks"**
- Looking at numbers in isolation
- **Fix:** Compare to budget, last year, industry average

** Mistake 3: "Report Overload"**
- Creating 20 reports, checking none
- **Fix:** 3-5 actionable reports max

** Mistake 4: "No Follow-Up"**
- Looking at data, taking no action
- **Fix:** Every report should lead to decision/action

## F&B-Specific Analytics

**Menu Engineering Matrix:**

| Category | High Margin | Low Margin |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **High Volume** | Stars (promote!) | Workhorses (raise price) |
| **Low Volume** | Puzzles (market better) | Dogs (remove from menu) |

**How to Use:**
1. Export item sales + margin data
2. Plot on matrix
3. Take action per category

**PWBI Tip:** Use "Item Performance" report, filter by profitability and volume. See [[products/10-menu-engineering/10-menu-engineering|Menu Engineering]].

## Report Sharing

**Share Data with Team:**

**What to Share:**
- Managers: Full dashboards
- Staff: Only relevant metrics (e.g., waiters see tips, kitchen sees food waste)
- Investors: Monthly P&L, growth trends

**How to Share:**
- **Email schedules:** Auto-send daily/weekly
- **Shared link:** Real-time dashboard access
- **PDF export:** For presentations, meetings

**Security:** Settings → Users → Set role-based access (view-only, edit, admin).

## Mobile Reporting

**Check Metrics On the Go:**
- E1/R2: Mobile-responsive (use on phone browser)
- Power BI: Download Power BI Mobile App

**Use Cases:**

## Advanced: Cohort Analysis
