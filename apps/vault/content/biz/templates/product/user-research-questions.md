## Interview Best Practices

### DO:

 **Ask open-ended questions** - "Tell me about..." instead of "Do you like...?"
 **Listen more than talk** - 80/20 rule (them 80%, you 20%)
 **Dig deeper** - Use "Why?" and "Tell me more about that"
 **Stay neutral** - Don't pitch, don't defend, don't lead
 **Take notes** - Capture verbatim quotes and observations
 **Focus on past behavior** - "Last time you did X..." vs. "Would you do X?"

### DON'T:

 **Ask leading questions** - "Don't you think this is a great feature?"
 **Pitch your product** - You're learning, not selling
 **Accept hypotheticals** - "I would probably..." is not data
 **Skip the 'why'** - Always ask why they gave that answer
 **Interview only friendly users** - Talk to skeptics and churned users too
 **Ignore body language** - Hesitations and tone matter
