## Best Practices

### DO:

 **Start on time** - Respect everyone's schedule
 **Assign a notetaker** - Rotate responsibility
 **Record decisions clearly** - No ambiguity
 **Define action items with owners** - No "we should" without "who will"
 **Share notes within 24 hours** - Fresh context
 **Follow up on action items** - Track completion

### DON'T:

 **Skip the agenda** - Meetings without structure waste time
 **Document everything** - Focus on decisions and actions, not verbatim
 **Use jargon** - Write for future readers who may lack context
 **Forget to follow up** - Notes without action are useless
 **Make decisions without recording** - If it's not written, it didn't happen
