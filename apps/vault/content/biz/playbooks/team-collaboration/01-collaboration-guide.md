# Team Collaboration Guide

**Owner:** Operations + Leadership
**Last Updated:** December 2025

## Our Collaboration Philosophy

**Async-first, sync when valuable.** Default to documentation over meetings. Meet when needed for complex discussions or bonding.

## Communication Channels

### When to Use What

**Slack (real-time, informal):**
- Quick questions
- Status updates
- Urgent issues (P0/P1)
- Water cooler chat (#random)

**Email (formal, external):**
- Customer communication
- Partner/vendor communication
- Important announcements
- Legal/compliance matters

**Google Docs (collaboration):**
- RFCs (Request for Comments)
- Project plans
- Meeting notes
- Product specs

**GitHub/Linear (development):**
- Code reviews
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Technical discussions

**Meetings (sync, valuable):**
- Brainstorming
- Complex decisions
- Conflict resolution
- Team bonding

## Decision-Making

### Decision Framework

**Type 1 (Reversible "Two-way door"):**
- Examples: Try new tool, experiment with feature, adjust process
- Decision maker: Individual contributor or team lead
- Timeline: Hours to days
- Approval: Inform team, proceed

**Type 2 (Irreversible "One-way door"):**
- Examples: Hire, fire, major architectural change, pricing change
- Decision maker: Leadership + stakeholders
- Timeline: Days to weeks
- Approval: RFC → discussion → decision → announce

### RFC Process (Request for Comments)

**When to use:** Type 2 decisions, cross-team impact, significant investment

**Template:**
```markdown
# RFC: [Title]

## Context
What problem are we solving?

## Proposal
What's the solution?

## Alternatives Considered
What else did we think about?

## Impact
Who's affected? What changes?

## Timeline
When do we need to decide?

## Open Questions
What's unclear?
```

**Process:**
1. Author creates RFC (Google Doc)
2. Share in #rfc channel
3. Comment period (3-7 days)
4. Incorporate feedback
5. Decision maker decides
6. Announce decision + rationale

### Disagree and Commit

**Principle:** Voice disagreement during discussion. Once decided, commit fully.

**How it works:**
- Debate vigorously (ideas, not people)
- Present data/arguments
- Decision maker decides
- Everyone commits (even if you disagree)
- No undermining ("I told you so")

**Re-evaluate:** If evidence changes significantly, revisit decision.

## Meetings

### Meeting Principles

1. **Default to no meeting** - Can this be async?
2. **Clear purpose** - Why are we meeting?
3. **Agenda required** - No agenda? Decline.
4. **Right attendees** - Only invite essential people
5. **Start/end on time** - Respect everyone's calendar
6. **Take notes** - Document decisions/actions
7. **Assign actions** - Who does what by when?

### Meeting Types

**Daily Standup (Async in Slack):**
- What: Yesterday, Today, Blockers
- When: Post by 10 AM
- Duration: N/A (async)

**Weekly Team Sync:**
- What: Progress, blockers, priorities
- When: Monday 10 AM
- Duration: 30 min
- Attendees: Team + manager

**1:1s (Manager + Direct Report):**
- What: Career, feedback, support
- When: Weekly or biweekly
- Duration: 30 min
- Agenda: Employee drives

**Planning (Sprint/Product):**
- What: Roadmap, priorities, estimation
- When: Start of sprint
- Duration: 1-2 hours
- Attendees: Product + Engineering

**Retrospective:**
- What: What went well, what didn't, actions
- When: End of sprint/project
- Duration: 1 hour
- Format: Start/Stop/Continue

**All-Hands:**
- What: Company updates, wins, Q&A
- When: Monthly
- Duration: 1 hour
- Attendees: Everyone

### Meeting Etiquette

**Before:**
- Accept/decline promptly
- Review agenda
- Prepare (read pre-reads)

**During:**
- Camera on (default, ok to turn off for personal reasons)
- Mute when not speaking
- Don't multitask (close other windows)
- Raise hand (don't interrupt)
- Take turns speaking

**After:**
- Notes shared (within 24 hours)
- Actions logged (who, what, when)
- Follow up on commitments

### "No Meeting" Blocks

**Protected time for focus work:**
- Block your calendar
- Decline meetings during these blocks
- Team respects blocks

**Recommended:**
- Mornings (9-12 PM): Deep work
- Fridays after 2 PM: No meetings

---

## Feedback Culture

### Giving Feedback

**Make it:**
- **Timely:** Don't wait (within 48 hours)
- **Specific:** Examples, not generalizations
- **Actionable:** What to do differently
- **Private:** 1:1, not in group
- **Balanced:** Positive + constructive

**Framework: SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact)**
- Situation: "In yesterday's client call..."
- Behavior: "...you interrupted the customer..."
- Impact: "...they seemed frustrated and we lost trust."

**Ask permission:** "Can I give you some feedback on the presentation?"

### Receiving Feedback

**Listen:**
- Don't interrupt
- Don't defend immediately
- Ask clarifying questions
- Thank them

**Reflect:**
- Is there truth here?
- What can I learn?
- What will I do differently?

**Follow up:**
- Apply feedback
- Check in: "I've been working on X, how am I doing?"

## Cross-Functional Collaboration

### Engineering + Product

**Collaboration points:**
- Sprint planning (prioritization)
- Refinement (clarify requirements)
- Demos (show progress)
- Retros (improve process)

**Best practices:**
- Product writes specs, Engineering reviews
- Engineering estimates, Product prioritizes
- Early involvement (don't throw specs over wall)
- Celebrate wins together

### Product + Design

**Collaboration:**
- User research together
- Design reviews (iterate)
- Usability testing
- Launch together

### Sales + Product

**Collaboration:**
- Sales shares customer feedback (weekly)
- Product shares roadmap (transparency)
- Beta testing coordination (select customers)
- Win/loss analysis (why did we win/lose?)

### CS + Everyone

**CS is voice of customer:**
- Share customer pain points (weekly digest)
- Feature requests logged (Product triages)
- Bug reports escalated (Engineering fixes)
- Success stories shared (celebrate!)

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Healthy Conflict

**Encouraged:**
- Debate ideas
- Challenge assumptions
- Push for better solutions
- Ask tough questions

**Not ok:**
- Personal attacks
- Passive-aggressive behavior
- Withholding information
- Undermining decisions

### When Conflict Arises

**Step 1: Direct conversation** (most conflicts resolved here)
- Talk 1:1
- Use SBI framework
- Seek to understand
- Find common ground

**Step 2: Involve manager** (if Step 1 doesn't work)
- Manager facilitates discussion
- Helps find compromise
- Documents agreement

**Step 3: Escalate to HR/Leadership** (serious conflicts)
- Mediation
- Formal process
- Disciplinary action (if needed)

---

## Async Collaboration Best Practices

### Writing

**Be clear:**
- What's the context?
- What's the ask?
- When do you need response?

**Be concise:**
- TL;DR at top (exec summary)
- Bullets > paragraphs
- Links to context (don't repeat)

**Be respectful:**
- No expectation of immediate response
- Provide deadline ("Need by EOD Friday")
- Say thanks

### Slack

**Use threads:**
- Keep conversations organized
- Don't clutter channel

**Use reactions:**
- = "I agree"
- = "I saw this"
- = "Thanks"

**Status:**
- Update status ("In meeting," "Focus time," "Lunch")
- Set working hours
- Notification schedule (mute after hours)

**Channels:**
- #general: Company announcements
- #random: Non-work chat
- #wins: Celebrate successes
- #help: Ask for help
- Project-specific: #project-name

---

## Documentation

### Why Document

**"If it's not documented, it doesn't exist."**

- Async-friendly (people can read anytime)
- Onboarding (new hires catch up)
- Knowledge sharing (not in one person's head)
- Decisions explained (future context)

### What to Document

**Always:**
- Decisions (why did we decide X?)
- Processes (how do we do Y?)
- Meeting notes (what was discussed?)
- Technical specs (how does it work?)
- Troubleshooting (how to fix common issues?)

**Example tools:**
- Notion: Company wiki
- Google Docs: Collaborative editing
- GitHub: Code + technical docs
- Miro: Visual collaboration

### Documentation Best Practices

**Make it findable:**
- Clear titles
- Tags/categories
- Linked from relevant places
- Search works

**Keep it updated:**
- Review quarterly
- Mark outdated docs
- Archive obsolete docs
