## Scaling Challenges

**From 100 → 1,000 Customers:**
- Manual processes break
- Support overwhelms team
- Technical infrastructure limits
- Team hiring/training urgent

---

## Operational Scaling Framework

### 1. Automate Everything Possible
**Manual → Automated:**
- Customer provisioning (manual → API)
- Onboarding (calls → self-serve videos + checklist)
- Reporting (spreadsheets → dashboards)
- Billing (manual invoices → auto-billing)

**Tools:**
- Zapier/Make (workflow automation)
- CRM automation (Hubspot/Salesforce)
- Customer health scoring (auto-calc)

### 2. Hire Ahead of the Curve
**Team Growth Plan (2025):**
- Q1: +5 (2 sales, 2 CS, 1 eng)
- Q2: +8 (3 sales, 3 CS, 2 eng)
- Q3: +10 (4 sales, 4 CS, 2 eng)
- Q4: +12 (5 sales, 5 CS, 2 eng)

**Total:** 35 new hires (60 → 95 team)

### 3. Process Documentation
**All SOPs written & maintained:**
- Sales (lead to close)
- CS (onboarding to renewal)
- Support (ticket handling)
- Engineering (deployment, maintenance)

### 4. Tech Infrastructure
**Current:** Single server, manual scaling
**Needed:** Auto-scaling, load balancing, CDN

**Migration Plan:**
- Q1: Cloud migration (AWS/GCP)
- Q2: Auto-scaling setup
- Q3: Global CDN
- Q4: Multi-region redundancy
