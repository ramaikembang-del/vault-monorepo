- Sprint 4-6: Formal partnership negotiation

---

## Target Partner Landscape

### Tier 1: Must-Have Partnerships (Essential)

#### 1. Pawoon
**Company Profile:**
- Market position: #2 POS in Indonesia
- Merchant base: 30,000+
- Segment: SME F&B (sweet spot for us)
- Pricing: Rp 300-500K/month per merchant
- HQ: Jakarta

**Strategic Fit:** (Highest)
- Target market overlap: 80% (both target Phase 2-3 SME)
- Tech-forward brand (open to innovation)
- Feature gap: Weak analytics (our strength)

**Partnership Value to Them:**
- Upsell analytics without dev investment
- Differentiation vs. Moka (who has better analytics)
- Customer retention (analytics = stickier customers)
- Revenue share (Rp 50K/merchant/month × 30K = Rp 1.5B opportunity)

**Partnership Value to Us:**
- 30K merchant distribution
- Brand credibility ("Powered by Pawoon partner")
- Integration priority (direct support from their team)

---

#### 2. Moka
**Company Profile:**
- Market position: #1 POS in Indonesia
- Merchant base: 40,000+
- Segment: Premium F&B (cafés, upscale restaurants)
- Pricing: Rp 500K-1M/month
- Backing: GoPay/Gojek parent company

**Strategic Fit:** (High)
- Premium segment: Higher willingness to pay for analytics
- Brand strength: Association boosts our credibility
- Feature parity: They HAVE analytics (competitive threat)

**Partnership Angle:**
- **Option A (Preferred):** White-label - We power their analytics backend
- **Option B:** Integration - Listed in their app marketplace
- **Option C:** Co-marketing - Joint customer webinars

**Challenge:** They may prefer to build analytics in-house (larger team, more resources)

**Counter:** We can build faster (AI-coded) + deeper F&B expertise

---

#### 3. Qasir
**Company Profile:**
- Market position: #3-4 POS (tied with Olsera)
- Merchant base: 20,000+
- Segment: Budget F&B (warungs, small cafés)
- Pricing: Rp 150-300K/month (low-cost leader)

**Strategic Fit:** (High)
- Budget segment: Our freemium E1 (Lite) is perfect fit
- Low competition: Less likely to have analytics feature
- Distribution: Reaches Phase 1 personas we struggle to acquire directly

**Partnership Angle:**
- Bundle our E1 (Lite) as free value-add for Qasir Pro customers
- Upsell to paid tiers when they outgrow free limits
- Revenue share: 20% of upgrades from their referrals

---

### Tier 2: Nice-to-Have (Expand Coverage)

4. **Olsera** (20K merchants) - Tier 1 cities, similar to Moka
5. **Cashlez** (15K merchants) - Payment-focused, less F&B-specific
6. **BukuWarung** (100K+ micro-merchants) - Too small for our analytics fit
7. **HashMicro** (Enterprise POS) - High-value but small volume

---

## Partnership Models

### Model A: White-Label / Embedded Analytics (Preferred for A3)

**Structure:**
- We build analytics dashboard
- POS company brands it as "Moka Analytics" or "Pawoon Insights"
- We provide backend API + hosting
- They handle customer support (L1), we handle technical support (L2)

**Economics:**
- **Option 1 (Per-Merchant Fee):** Rp 50K/merchant/month
 - Pawoon: 30K merchants × Rp 50K = Rp 1.5B/month revenue to POS
 - They pay us Rp 25-35K per merchant = Rp 750M-1B to us
- **Option 2 (Revenue Share):** 30-40% of their analytics upsell revenue
- **Option 3 (Fixed Monthly):** Rp 10-20M/month platform fee (unlimited merchants)

**Typical Split:** They keep 60%, we get 40% (covers our infrastructure + development)

**Their Benefits:**
- Zero dev cost (we build everything)
- Instant feature parity with competitors
- Recurring revenue stream (monetize existing merchant base)
- Customer retention boost (analytics makes POS more valuable)

**Our Benefits:**
- 30K+ distribution overnight
- Zero direct CAC (they acquire, we serve)
- Brand association (credibility via their endorsement)
- Data access (30K merchants feeding our benchmarking database)

---

### Model B: Integration Partnership (Fallback)

**Structure:**
- We build API integration with their POS system
- Listed in their "App Marketplace" as certified partner
- Customers pay us directly (not through POS)
- POS provides technical documentation + support

**Economics:**
- **Revenue share:** POS gets 10-20% of our sales from their referrals
- **Or:** No revenue share, just mutual marketing benefit

**Their Benefits:**
- Ecosystem expansion (more apps = more value)
- No financial risk (we invest in integration)
- Potential referral revenue (if they choose to participate)

**Our Benefits:**
- Official endorsement (listed as partner)
- Easier customer onboarding (pre-built integration)
- Access to their merchant base via marketing

**Lower value than Model A** but easier to secure (less commitment from POS)

---

### Model C: Co-Marketing Partnership (Minimum)

**Structure:**
- Joint content: webinars, case studies, blog posts
- Cross-promotion: We promote their POS, they promote our analytics
- No direct revenue share

**Economics:**
- No money exchanged
- Pure marketing value (credibility, reach)

**Their Benefits:**
- Thought leadership (educate market on data-driven F&B)
- Customer engagement (free webinars add value)

**Our Benefits:**
- Credibility by association
- Access to their audience (email lists, social channels)

**Easiest to secure** but lowest value (no distribution unlock)

---

## Partnership Approach Strategy

### Phase 1: Build Credibility (Sprint 1-2)

**Objective:** Prove we have customer traction before approaching POS partners

**Milestones:**
- Get 50+ Lite users (show product works)
- Get 10+ paying customers (show revenue potential)
- Get 3+ testimonials (show customer satisfaction)
- Build integration demo (show technical capability)

**Why This Matters:**
POS companies won't partner with unproven startups. We need social proof first.

**Timeline:** Achieve by end of Sprint 2 (Week 8)

---

### Phase 2: Initial Outreach (Sprint 2)

**Step 1: Research Decision Makers**
- LinkedIn search: "Pawoon" + "Product Manager" OR "Business Development"
- Target: Product Lead, Partnerships Lead, CEO (if startup-stage)

**Step 2: Warm Intro (if possible)**
- Check network: Any mutual connections to Pawoon team?
- Use investors/advisors for introduction
- **Fallback:** Cold email if no warm intro available

**Step 3: Initial Email (Cold Outreach Template)**

### Phase 3: Pitch Meeting (Sprint 2-3)

**Meeting Structure (30 minutes):**

**Minutes 1-5: Problem**
- "Your merchants want analytics, but building in-house takes 6-12 months"
- "We've already built it. 50+ restaurants are using it today."

**Minutes 6-15: Demo**

**Minutes 16-25: Business Model**
- Propose revenue share: Rp 50K per merchant, split 60/40 or 50/50
- Show economics: 30K merchants × Rp 30K (your cut) = Rp 900M/month
- Compare to hiring analytics team: Rp 500M+ dev cost + 6-12 months

**Minutes 26-30: Next Steps**

- Timeline: Pilot in 6 weeks

**Objections to Prepare For:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're building our own analytics" | "That's 6-12 months. We can launch in 6 weeks. Pilot us first, then decide." |
| "Our merchants won't pay extra" | "Bundle it free for Pro tier, upsell Basic to Pro. Net increase in ARPU." |
| "We need full control" | "White-label means YOUR brand. We're invisible backend. Full control on pricing/positioning." |
| "Integration is complex" | "We handle it. Give us API docs, we build connector in 2 weeks." |
| "What if you go out of business?" | "Contract includes code escrow. If we fail, you get full source code." |

### Phase 4: Pilot Program (Sprint 3)

**Pilot Structure:**

**Participants:** 100 Pawoon merchants (hand-picked by them)
**Duration:** 3 months
**Pricing:** Free (we absorb costs to prove value)
**Deliverables:**
- White-labeled dashboard ("Pawoon Analytics")
- Automated POS data sync (daily)
- Basic support (email, 48h SLA)

**Success Metrics:**
- Merchant usage: 60%+ active weekly
- Merchant satisfaction: NPS > 40
- Feature requests: List for roadmap prioritization
- Conversion: X% would pay Rp 50K/month (price test)

**Investment Required:**
- Dev time: 3 weeks (build white-label version + integration)
- Infrastructure: Rp 2M (cloud hosting for 100 merchants × 3 months)
- Support: 5-10 hours/week (pilot support load)

**ROI if Successful:**
- Partnership: 30K merchants × Rp 25K (our cut) = Rp 750M/month = Rp 9B ARR
- **Payback on Rp 2M investment: 2 days** if full rollout happens

---

### Phase 5: Formal Partnership Negotiation (Sprint 4-6)

**If Pilot Succeeds (60%+ metrics hit), negotiate formal agreement:**

**Contract Terms:**
1. **Exclusivity:** None (we integrate with all POS systems)
 - **Exception:** If they want exclusivity, charge 2× (Rp 50K → Rp 100K our cut)

2. **Revenue Split:** 60% POS / 40% us (on per-merchant fee)
 - **Alternative:** Fixed platform fee Rp 15M/month (unlimited merchants)

3. **Support Model:**
 - L1 (merchant questions): POS handles via their existing support
 - L2 (technical issues): We handle via dedicated Slack channel
 - **SLA:** 48-hour response for critical issues

4. **Data Ownership:**
 - Merchant data: Jointly owned (both can use for product improvement)
 - Anonymized benchmarking: We can use (key for D1: Industry Reports)
 - POS proprietary data: They retain full rights

5. **Term:** 2-year initial term, auto-renew annually
 - **Exit clause**: 90-day notice, transition period for merchant data export

6. **Integration Maintenance:**
 - We maintain integration (updates for new POS versions)
 - **SLA:** Working integration within 2 weeks of POS API changes

7. **White-Label Branding:**
 - They choose brand name ("Pawoon Analytics", "Moka Insights", etc.)
 - We provide logo placement areas (they provide logo files)
 - Marketing materials: Co-created (we draft, they approve)

---

## Contingency Plan: If POS Partnerships Fail

**Scenario:** All Tier 1 POS partners decline or stall (6+ months no progress)

**Plan B: Direct API Integration (No Partnership Required)**

**Strategy:**
- Build API connectors ourselves (without official partnership)
- Market as "Works with Moka/Pawoon/Qasir" (unofficial)
- Target merchants directly, handle integration setup

**Implications:**
- No partnership revenue (lower value)
- No distribution leverage (harder customer acquisition)
- Still functional for C1-C4 (SaaS customers need POS sync)
- A3 (Embedded Analytics) blocked (requires official white-label deal)

**Timeline:** Deprioritize A3 to Year 2, focus on C1-C4 growth first

---

## Success Criteria

**Phase 2b Partnership Strategy is SUCCESSFUL when:**
- 1+ Tier 1 partnership in pilot stage (Sprint 3-4)
- Formal partnership contract signed with 1+ POS (Sprint 5-6)
- A3 (Embedded Analytics) successfully unlocked
- 1,000+ merchants using embedded version within 6 months of launch

**Phase 2b is COMPLETE when:**
- This partnership strategy document exists
- Target partner list identified
- Outreach templates ready
- Pilot program structure defined

---

**Next Actions (Sprint 1-2):**
1. Build customer testimonials (3+ case studies)
2. Create partnership pitch deck (10 slides)
3. Build white-label demo (rebrandable dashboard)
4. Research decision makers at Pawoon/Moka/Qasir
5. Draft outreach emails (personalized per partner)

**Priority Level:** HIGH (Unlocks A3, 2nd highest revenue potential after C1-C4)
