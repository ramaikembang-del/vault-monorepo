## Executive Summary

> [!NOTE]
> **Universal Framework:** This TAM/SAM/SOM analysis covers the **Full SaaS Platform** targeting Phase 2-5 (SME segment). See [[biz/strategy/market-analysis/02-market-segmentation.md|Market Segmentation]] for the complete 19 personas across 5 maturity phases.
>
> **Product Scope:**
> - **This TAM (10,500):** Full SaaS Platform (Phase 2-5, 10+ staff, cloud SaaS)
> - **Web Dashboard Lite:** Serves Phase 1 (Mikro, 1-9 staff, offline) - separate TAM not included here

**Market Sizing Framework:**
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** ~100,000 restaurants & cafÃ©s in Indonesia
- **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):** ~10,500 qualified restaurants (10.5% of TAM)
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** 315-525 customers by Year 5-7 (3-5% of SAM)

**Key Findings:**
- Initial estimate (1,500) was actually SOM, not SAM - severely underestimated serviceable market
- Indonesia's F&B sector has 100K+ restaurants/cafÃ©s (TAM) and 250K+ total F&B businesses
- Our accessible pricing (Rp 300K entry) expands serviceable market to 10,500 qualified restaurants
- SAM (10,500) = realistic 10.5% of TAM based on qualification criteria (10+ staff, Rp 50M+ revenue, tech-ready)
- Conservative 1.2% SAM penetration by Year 3 = 130 customers (current business plan)
- Moderate 3% SAM penetration by Year 5 = 315 customers (ARR ~Rp 5-6B)
- SOM represents only 0.3-0.5% of TAM - very realistic market share target

## Methodology

### **Bottom-Up Approach:**
1. Segment Indonesia by city tiers (Tier 1/2/3)
2. Estimate total F&B establishments per tier
3. Apply qualification filters
4. Segment qualified restaurants by business size (matches our pricing tiers)

### **Qualification Criteria:**
- **Minimum staff:** 10+ employees (excludes micro businesses)
- **Minimum revenue:** Rp 50M+ annually (~Rp 4M/month)
- **Technology readiness:** POS system or digital payment acceptance
- **Decision-maker accessibility:** Owner/manager willing to adopt SaaS

**Rationale:** Smaller businesses (<10 staff, <Rp 50M revenue) unlikely to afford Rp 300K/month analytics or have data infrastructure.

- **GTM strategy:** Tier 1 cities first (6,000 TAM, 57% of total) for efficient CAC
