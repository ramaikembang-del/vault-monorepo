### Total Addressable Market (TAM) - Company Level

**Definition**: All hospitality businesses in Indonesia that could theoretically use business intelligence software (ANY of our products)

#### Hospitality UMKM Breakdown

| Segment | Count | % of Total |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **F&B** (restaurants, cafés, catering) | 750,000 | 38% |
| **Accommodation** (hotels, homestays, villas) | 50,000 | 2.5% |
| **Tourism Services** (tours, guides, transport) | 200,000 | 10% |
| **Event Services** (wedding, corporate events) | 30,000 | 1.5% |
| **Other Hospitality** | 150,000 | 7.5% |
| **Total Hospitality UMKM** | **1,950,000** | **100%** |

**Company-Level TAM = 1.95M hospitality UMKM**

**F&B-Specific TAM (Primary Focus):**
- **750,000 F&B UMKM** (restaurants, cafés, catering, street food, warung)
- **100,000 modern restaurants** (sit-down, QSR chains - subset of 750K, excludes street food/kiosks)

**Data Sources:**
- BPS (Badan Pusat Statistik) - UMKM Indonesia 2023 Statistics
- Industry estimates (Gojek/Grab merchant data, POS vendor reports)
- Bottom-up city-by-city validation (Jakarta 15K + Surabaya 10K + Bandung 8K + Tier 2-3 cities ~67K = 100K modern restaurants)

At avg Rp 200k/mo subscription → **Rp 468B annual TAM** (company-level, all products)

---

### Serviceable Available Market (SAM) - Company Level

**Definition**: Portion of TAM we can realistically serve with our current/planned product suite

#### Company-Level SAM Calculation

**For ALL products combined:**
1. **Digital ready** (has POS or uses basic digital tools): 40% of TAM = 780K businesses
2. **Revenue >Rp 50M/year** (can afford/value BI): 60% of digital ready = 468K businesses
3. **Indonesia geography** focus (vs regional): 100% = 468K businesses

**Company SAM = 468K businesses** (serves all products: Power BI Template, Web Dashboard Lite, Full SaaS Platform)

At avg Rp 200k/mo → **Rp 112B annual SAM**

---

#### Product-Specific SAM Breakdown

Different products serve different segments with different qualification criteria:

| Product | TAM | SAM Filters | SAM Size | % of Product TAM |
|---------|-----|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **Product 01** (Power BI Template) | 100K modern restaurants | Digital-ready (50%), Revenue >Rp 250M/year (70%), 5+ staff (75%) | **20-25K** | 20-25% |
| **Product 03** (Web Dashboard Lite) | 750K F&B UMKM | Digital-ready (30%), Revenue >Rp 50M/year (80%), Internet access (80%) | **100-150K** | 13-20% |
| **Product 05** (Full SaaS Platform) | 100K modern restaurants | 10+ staff (40%), Revenue >Rp 500M/year (50%), Willing to pay Rp 300K+/month (60%) | **10-12K** | 10-12% |

**Key Insight:** Product 01 (one-time purchase) has wider SAM than Product 05 (SaaS subscription) due to lower commitment barrier.

---

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) - Company Level

**Definition**: Realistic market share we can capture in 3-5 years across all products

#### SOM by Phase (All Products Combined)

**Year 3 (2027) Target**:
```
Product 01 (Power BI Template): 650 cumulative sales
Product 03 (Web Dashboard Lite): 500 paid users (8,500 free users)
Product 05 (Full SaaS Platform): 130 paid users

Total Paid Users: ~1,280 customers
Total Users (incl free tier): ~9,000 users ← This is where "9,000" comes from!
```

**Clarification on "9,000 users Year 3":**
- 9,000 = **Total active users** (free tier + paid customers across all products)
- 1,280 = **Paid customers only** (revenue-generating)
- Avg revenue Rp 250k/mo blended = Rp 3.8B ARR (Year 3)

**NOT:** 9,000 paid customers (that would be ~Rp 27B ARR - unrealistic for Year 3)

**Year 5 (2029) Target**: 15% of F&B + 5% of Accommodation
```
F&B: 180K × 15% = 27,000 users
Accommodation: 20K × 5% = 1,000 users
Total: 28,000 paid users
Avg revenue Rp 300k/mo = Rp 100 M ARR
```

**Year 10 (2034) Target**: Market leader
```
30% of F&B SAM = 54,000 users
20% of Accommodation = 4,000 users
10% of Tourism/Events = 23,000 users
Total: 81,000 paid users
Avg revenue Rp 400k/mo = Rp 390 M ARR
```

## Market Entry Barriers

### Low Barriers (Good for us!)

 No dominant F&B BI player
 High fragmentation (easy to start small)
 Cloud infrastructure mature
 Payment/distribution channels established
 Govt supportive of UMKM digitalization

### Medium Barriers (Manageable)

User education needed (BI not yet "must-have")
Integration complexity (many POS systems)
Trust building (new brand)
Capital required for scale (marketing, tech)

### High Barriers (Avoid these segments)

 Enterprise (long sales cycles, RFPs)
 Regulated industries (banking-grade compliance)
 International expansion (different regulations)

**Our Strategy**: Focus on low-barrier SMB market, avoid enterprise initially

### Methodology Notes

#### SAM Filter Assumptions

**Product 01 (Power BI Template) - SAM = 20-25K:**
1. **Digital-ready**: 50% of 100K TAM = 50,000 (have POS or use digital tools)
2. **Revenue >Rp 250M/year**: 70% of digital-ready = 35,000 (can afford Rp 2-17M investment)
3. **5+ staff**: 75% of viable revenue = 26,250 (need analytics for team management)
4. **Result**: ~20-25K SAM (conservative rounding)

**Confidence Level:** 80% (filters based on industry norms and POS vendor data)

**Product 03 (Web Dashboard Lite) - SAM = 100-150K:**
1. **Digital-ready**: 30% of 750K TAM = 225,000 (lower barrier than Product 01)
2. **Revenue >Rp 50M/year**: 80% of digital-ready = 180,000 (can afford Rp 0-199K/mo)
3. **Internet access**: 80% of viable = 144,000
4. **Result**: 100-150K SAM (adjusted for market conditions)

**Confidence Level:** 70% (broader market, more uncertainty)

---

### Data Quality Assessment

| Data Type | Confidence Level | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Government statistics (BPS) | 90-95% | Official census, high quality but may lag 1-2 years |
| POS vendor counts | 70-80% | Self-reported, may include inactive users |
| Food delivery platform data | 60-70% | Includes segments outside our TAM (street food) |
| Bottom-up city counts | 60-95% (varies by tier) | Tier 1 cities high confidence, long tail lower |
| Market surveys | 70-75% | Small samples, single-city bias |
| **Overall TAM/SAM Confidence** | **75-80%** | Multiple data sources triangulate to consistent range |

---

### Known Data Gaps & Mitigation

**Gap 1: Exact POS adoption rates by city tier**
- **Mitigation**: Using national average (9%) with ±3% variance by tier
- **Impact**: SAM estimate may vary ±15%

**Gap 2: Revenue distribution within UMKM segment**
- **Mitigation**: BPS provides revenue bands, not exact distribution
- **Impact**: SAM filters (>Rp 250M/year) have ±20% uncertainty

**Gap 3: Digital readiness beyond POS usage**
- **Mitigation**: Proxying via smartphone penetration (85%), cloud tool usage (70%)
- **Impact**: May overestimate digital-ready by 10-15%

**Gap 4: Willingness to pay validation**
- **Mitigation**: Single-city survey (Bandung), extrapolated nationally
- **Impact**: Regional variance not captured (Jakarta higher WTP, Tier 3 lower)

---

### Validation Checklist

| Validation Item | Status | Evidence |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| TAM (100K modern restaurants) validated bottom-up | | 103,350 city-by-city count (103% of claim) |
| TAM (750K F&B UMKM) matches BPS data | | BPS UMKM report 2023 |
| POS adoption (70K users) matches vendor data | | Pawoon 30K + Moka 15K + Qasir 10K + others ~15K |
| SAM filters (20-25K for Product 01) justified | | Digital-ready 50% × Revenue filter 70% × Staff filter 75% |
| Gojek/Grab merchant count (150K) reconciled | Partial | Includes street food/warungs (outside TAM), validates lower bound |
| Survey data (willingness to pay) statistically significant | Partial | Single city (Bandung), n=500, needs multi-city validation |
| Revenue estimates (Rp 112B SAM) cross-checked | Partial | Based on avg Rp 200K/mo assumption, needs pricing validation |

---

### Next Steps for Data Validation (Priority 3)

**Week 2-3 (Optional Enhancements):**
1. **Add specific URLs**: Replace all `[TBD]` placeholders with actual report links
2. **Multi-city surveys**: Validate willingness to pay in Jakarta, Surabaya (not just Bandung)
3. **POS vendor interviews**: Request actual active user counts (not cumulative signups)
4. **F&B association data**: Partner with PHRI for member database access
5. **Google Maps scraping**: Automate restaurant count validation for Tier 2-3 cities

**Status:** Market sizing is defensible with current data (75-80% confidence). Above enhancements would increase to 85-90% confidence.

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-28
**Data Sources Owner:** Business Intelligence Team
**Next Review:** After Sprint 1 Week 2 (validate TAM assumptions with actual customer data)
