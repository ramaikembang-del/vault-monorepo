## Research Methodology

### Primary Research (2025-2025)

**Interviews**: 47 F&B owners (cafés, restaurants, catering)
**Surveys**: 312 responses (online + in-person)
**Observational**: 15 site visits to small F&B businesses
**Secondary**: Industry reports, government data, competitor analysis

---

## Key Finding #1: The Profitability Blindness

### The Problem

**78% of F&B UMKM owners don't know their real-time profitability**

**Quotes**:
> "I feel like we're busy, customers keep coming, but at the end of the month... where did the money go?" - Pak

 Budi, Café Owner

> "I count cash every night. If there's money, I think I'm profitable. But apparently that's not how it works." - Ibu Sarah, Caterer

### Root Causes

| Cause | % Affected | Impact |
|-------|------------|--------|
| No accounting system | 65% | Can't track costs properly |
| Manual record keeping (paper) | 45% | Error-prone, incomplete |
| No separation of business/personal | 52% | Can't see true profit |
| Don't understand metrics (COGS, Prime Cost) | 71% | Misinterpret data |

### Consequences

- **40% discover losses only when bank account empty**
- **Average 3-6 month delay** between problem and awareness
- **30% fail in Year 1** due to preventable cash crises

**Our Solution**: Health Score (0-100) + daily profitability dashboard

## Key Finding #2: Menu Engineering is Guesswork

### The Problem

**85% make menu decisions based on gut feel, not data**

**Quotes**:
> "I keep items on the menu because I like them, not because they sell well." - Rio, Food Stall

> "Which dish is profitable? I don't know. I charge what my competitor charges." - Amanda, Café Chain

### Current Decision Process

```
Sales declining → Add new item (guesswork)
 ↓
 No data on what works
 ↓
 Keep low-margin items
 ↓
 Profitability suffers
```

### Data We Collected

**From 47 businesses analyzed**:
- Average menu has **40-60 items**
- **Top 20% items generate 60% of revenue**
- **Bottom 30% items average 8% margin** (vs 25% top items)
- **Removing bottom 5 items → avg +Rp 3M/year profit**

**Our Solution**: BCG Matrix automatically shows Stars/Dogs/Cash Cows/Question Marks

## Key Finding #3: Labor Cost Mystery

### The Problem

**68% don't track labor cost as % of revenue**

**Quotes**:
> "I hire when we're busy,fire when slow. No real system." - Paman Joko, Hotel F&B

> "My labor cost this month? Let me think... 5 people × Rp 3 Jt = Rp 15 Jt? But it feels higher." - Andi, Restaurant Chain

### Industry Benchmarks vs Reality

| Metric | Industry Best Practice | Average UMKM Reality | Gap |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-----|
| Labor Cost % | 25-28% of revenue | 32-40% | +7-15% |
| Prime Cost % | 60-65% | 68-78% | +8-13% |
| Efficiency | Rp 500k revenue/labor hour | Rp 300k | -40% |

**Our Solution**: Heatmap shows peak hours → optimize staff schedule

## Key Finding #4: Expansion Anxiety

### The Problem

**73% of growing businesses (2+ outlets) feel "out of control"**

**Quotes**:
> "Opening 2nd café was a mistake. I can't see both at once. Just trusting my manager with WhatsApp updates." - Amanda, 3-outlet chain

> "Each outlet has different profitability but I don't know why. Is it location? Menu? Staff?" - Andi, 8-outlet chain

### Data on Multi-Outlet Challenges

**Surveyed 52 multi-outlet owners**:

| Challenge | % Reporting | Avg Time Lost/Week |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Manual consolidation of sales data | 87% | 3 hours |
| Inconsistent data formats | 65% | 2 hours |
| Can't compare outlet performance | 78% | N/A |
