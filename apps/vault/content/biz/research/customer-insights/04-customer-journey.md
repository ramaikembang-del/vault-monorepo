## Journey Phase 1: SURVIVE (Usaha Mikro)

### Customer Profile

| Attribute | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| **Business Stage** | 0-2 years old |
| **Revenue** | <Rp 300M/year |
| **Staff** | 1-4 (owner + helpers) |
| **Outlets** | 1 location |
| **Mindset** | "Just trying to make it through the month" |
| **Tech Adoption** | Low to medium (POS maybe, WhatsApp definitely) |

### The Survival Challenge

**Reality Check:**
- 70% of F&B businesses fail in Year 1
- Most don't know they're failing until it's too late
- No time for analysis; owner does everything
- Decisions made on gut feeling, not data

**Core Question**: *"Am I going to survive this month?"*

### Their Journey With Us

#### Stage 1A: Awareness
**Trigger**: Fear moment ("Why is my bank account low?")
**Channel**: Instagram ad, Google search, friend referral
**Message**: "70% fail in Year 1. Don't be one of them. Know your business health in 30 seconds."

#### Stage 1B: Consideration
**Questions They Ask**:
- Is this for businesses like mine?
- Can I actually use this? (I'm not tech-savvy)
- Will it cost me money?
- How long does it take?

**What We Show**:
- Demo video (30-second walkthrough)
- Testimonial from similar business
- "Free forever" messaging
- "5 minutes to start" promise

#### Stage 1C: Trial
**First 5 Minutes (Critical!)**:
1. Download desktop app
2. Upload sample data OR try demo data
3. See first dashboard
4. Discover 1 insight (**Aha moment!**)

**Aha Moment**: "Wow, my Prime Cost is 72%? That's why I'm losing money!"

#### Stage 1D: Activation
**Week 1 Goals**:
- Upload their own data (revenue.csv)
- Check dashboard 3+ times
- Find 1 actionable insight
- Tell 1 friend about it

**Activation Metric**: Uploaded own data + checked 3x in Week 1

#### Stage 1E: Retention
**Monthly Usage Pattern**:
- Daily: Quick health check (30 seconds)
- Weekly: Upload new data, review trends
- Monthly: Review P&L, make 1 decision based on data

**Retention Metric**: Active 3+ days per week at Month 3

#### Stage 1F: Advocacy
**Trigger**: Survived a crisis they saw coming
**Action**: Tells friends, shares screenshot on WhatsApp group
**Referral**: "Use this, it saved my café"

### Success Criteria (Phase 1)

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Still in business @ 12 months | 85% | vs 30% industry average |
| Knows profitability daily | 100% | Core value prop delivered |
| Makes data-driven decision monthly | 60% | Proof of utility |
| Refers 1+ friend | 40% | Product-market fit signal |

### Graduation Trigger → Phase 2

**Ready to move from SURVIVE to STABILIZE when:**
- Survived Year 1
- Consistently profitable for 3+ months
- Hiring 2nd employee OR opening 2nd outlet
- Outgrows Starter tier (need multi-device, cloud)

**Prompt in app**: "Congrats! You've been profitable for 3 months straight. Ready to scale? Upgrade to Growth tier to unlock cloud sync and hire with confidence."

| **Outlets** | 1-3 locations |
| **Mindset** | "I need to build systems, not just hustle" |
| **Tech Adoption** | Medium (using POS, accounting software) |

### The Stabilization Challenge

**Reality Check:**
- Transitioning from operator to manager
- Hiring creates new problems (training, management, theft)
- 2nd location is a whole new ballgame

### Their Journey With Us

#### Stage 2A: Upgrade Trigger
**What Changed**:

#### Stage 2B: Growth Tier Adoption
**New Features They Discover**:

2. Web access → Manager can check from their device
3. Multi-outlet comparison → Which location is better?

### Graduation Trigger → Phase 3

**Ready to move from STABILIZE to OPTIMIZE when:**

- Management layer in place (not just owner)
