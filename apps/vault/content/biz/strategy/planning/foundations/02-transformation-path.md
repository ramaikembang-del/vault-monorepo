## Key Inflection Points

- Recurring revenue engine established
- Can hire full-time team

**Inflection 3: SaaS Majority (Month 18)**

## Risk Mitigation

**Phase 1 Risk:** Product-market fit fails
- **Mitigation:** Dual validation (Template + Lite), pivot if <50% targets

**Phase 2 Risk:** Can't build recurring revenue
- **Mitigation:** Support product (low-friction MRR), test before SaaS

**Phase 3 Risk:** SaaS adoption too slow
- **Mitigation:** Keep templates (hybrid model OK), don't force platform shift

**Phase 4 Risk:** Churn increases as we scale
- **Mitigation:** Pillar 4 defense products, CS team scaling with growth
