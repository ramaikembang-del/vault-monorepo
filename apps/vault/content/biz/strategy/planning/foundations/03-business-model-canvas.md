## Executive Summary

**What We Sell:** Power BI dashboard templates for Indonesian F&B SMEs
**How We Sell It:** 3-tier model (DIY → Assisted → Managed)
**Core Positioning:** "Excel + Power BI" symbiosis (not replacement)
**Differentiation:** Transformation narrative + gamification + Indonesian cultural context

**Year 1 Target:**
- 50 customers (Tier 1: 30, Tier 2: 15, Tier 3: 5)

## 1. Value Proposition

### Core Value (The "Aha")

**Problem:** Indonesian F&B SME owners have data in Excel but can't "see" it clearly. They want professional analytics but fear:
- Ganti system (changing systems = staff retraining)
- Modal tipis, margin tipis (budget constraints)
- Complexity (gaptek tapi nggak mau ketinggalan)

**Solution:** "Power BI = Kacamata buat Excel"
- Staff tetap pakai Excel (familiar, no training)
- Owner dapat dashboard profesional (visual, insights)
- One-time payment (not subscription fatigue)

**Transformation Promise:**
```
Week 0: "Gue pusing liat Excel berantakan"
Week 1: "Wah, gue nemu food cost bocor 8%!"
Month 3: "Dashboard ini udah balik modal"
Month 6: "Gue buka outlet ke-2, upgrade ke Tier 2"
```

## 12. Competitive Advantages (Moats)

### 1. Transformation Narrative (Cultural Moat)

**What:**
- 10 Indonesian business angles (modal tipis margin tipis, gaptek, WiFi sering mati)

- F&B specific scenarios (food cost, menu engineering, peak hours)

**Why It's a Moat:**
- Hard to copy (requires deep cultural understanding)
- Resonates emotionally (not just functional)
- Builds brand loyalty

---

### 2. "Excel + Power BI" Positioning (Conceptual Moat)

**What:**
- Not replacement, but symbiosis
- "Kacamata buat Excel" metaphor
- Zero disruption to workflow

**Why It's a Moat:**
- Lowers customer resistance

- Unique value proposition

---

### 3. Gamification (Engagement Moat)

---

### 4. Network Effects (Data Moat)

**What:**

**Why It's a Moat:**
- More customers = more value for each customer
- Community creates switching cost
- Viral loop (referrals)

---

## 13. Risk Analysis

### Threats

**High Risk:**
1. **Template Copying:** Competitors reverse-engineer our template
 - **Mitigation:** Ship with obfuscated DAX, focus on service (not just template)

2. **Microsoft Policy Change:** Power BI Desktop becomes paid
 - **Mitigation:** Develop E1 (Web Dashboard) as backup platform

**Medium Risk:**
3. **Market Education:** Customers don't understand value of analytics
 - **Mitigation:** Demo video (2-minute aha moment), 30-day guarantee

4. **Substitute Threat:** Excel, Google Data Studio, POS built-in reports
 - **Mitigation:** "Excel + Power BI" positioning (not vs Excel)

**Low Risk:**
5. **Churn:** Customers buy once, never use
 - **Mitigation:** Gamification (daily engagement), onboarding focus
