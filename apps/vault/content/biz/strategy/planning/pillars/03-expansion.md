**Grow Revenue Per Customer Through Upsells, Cross-Sells, and Usage-Based Growth**

**Owner:** Product + Sales + Customer Success  
**Status:** ACTIVE - Foundational Strategy  
**Last Updated:** January 9, 2026

## Executive Summary

**Pillar 3 Mission:** Maximize revenue from existing customers by helping them scale their businesses and naturally graduate to higher-value tiers as they grow.

**Strategic Importance:**
- **Higher LTV:** Expansion revenue has 0 CAC (already acquired customers)
- **Predictable Growth:** Easier to forecast than new customer acquisition
- **Product Validation:** Customers paying more = product delivering more value
- **Capital Efficiency:** Expansion ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) is the best kind of growth

**Expansion Metrics (Targets):**
- **Net Revenue Retention (NRR):** >110% (expansion exceeds churn)
- **Upsell Rate:** 20%+ of customers upgrade within 12 months
- **Cross-Sell Rate:** 30%+ buy additional products/add-ons
- **ARPU Growth:** +15% YoY (average revenue per user increasing)

## Expansion Philosophy: "Growth with the Customer"

**Core Principle:** Our product tiers should match natural business growth stages

```
Customer Journey          Product Journey            Revenue Journey
─────────────────────    ──────────────────────    ────────────────
Phase 1 Mikro (Startup)  → Free Dashboard Lite    → Rp 0
↓ Business expands        ↓ Hits limits (30 days)  ↓
Phase 2 Naik Kelas       → Lite Paid              → Rp 200-350K/mo
↓ Multi-outlet, team     ↓ Needs cloud, team      ↓
Phase 2 Multi-Outlet     → SaaS Basic             → Rp 400-500K/mo
↓ Adds R2 tools          ↓ Bundles R2a+R2b+R2c    ↓
Phase 2+ Advanced        → SaaS Basic + R2 Pack   → Rp 600-750K/mo
↓ 3+ outlets, 5+ users   ↓ Needs multi-location   ↓
Phase 3 Scaling          → SaaS Pro               → Rp 800K-1.2M/mo
↓ Custom needs           ↓ Tailored dashboard     ↓
Phase 3 Enterprise       → Custom Dashboard       → Rp 3-8M/project
```

**Expansion is NOT:** Forcing upgrades. It's **removing friction** as customers naturally outgrow current tier.

## Expansion Triggers & In-App Prompts

### Usage-Based Triggers

**Trigger 1: Data Volume Limit**
- Free Lite: 30-day history reached
- **Prompt:** "You've tracked 30 days! Upgrade to see 12 months of trends. Rp 200K/mo"

**Trigger 2: Feature Limit**
- User tries to use locked feature (e.g., WhatsApp alerts)
- **Prompt:** "WhatsApp daily summaries available in Paid tier. Upgrade for Rp 350K/mo"

**Trigger 3: User Limit**
- User tries to invite 4th teammate (Basic allows 3 max)
- **Prompt:** "Need more users? Upgrade to Pro for 10 team seats. Rp 800K/mo"

**Trigger 4: Outlet Limit**
- User opens 2nd outlet, wants to track both
- **Prompt:** "Track all outlets in one dashboard. Upgrade to Pro for Rp 1.2M/mo"

---

### Time-Based Triggers

**Onboarding Upsell (Day 7):**
- User completes onboarding, actively using product
- **Prompt:** "You're a power user! Unlock advanced features with Pro. 30-day free trial?"

**Renewal Upsell (Month 11):**
- User approaching annual renewal
- **Prompt:** "Renew 1 year of Pro and save 20%. Lock in Rp 800K/mo rate."

**Seasonal Upsell (Tax Season):**
- March-April (Indonesian tax filing season)
- **Prompt:** "Get bank-ready P&L reports with Pro Pack. Tax season discount: 50% off first month"

---

### Behavioral Triggers

**Power User Pattern:**
- User logs in daily, uses 90% of features
- **Auto-qualify for upsell:** Sales team reaches out with Pro offer

**Team Expansion:**
- User invites 2nd user (Basic allows 3, they have room to grow)
- **Soft Prompt:** "Planning to add more team? Pro supports 10 users."

**Feature Request:**
- User submits feature request that exists in higher tier
- **Response:** "Good news! That's already in Pro tier. Want a demo?"

---

## Expansion Sales Playbook

### Self-Serve Upgrades (Default)

**In-App Upgrade Flow:**
1. User clicks "Upgrade" button in app
2. Shows tier comparison table (current vs upgraded)
3. One-click upgrade (no sales call needed)
4. Instant access to new features

**Target:** 80% of upgrades should be self-serve (frictionless)

---

### Sales-Assisted Upgrades (High-Touch)

**When to Involve Sales:**
- Enterprise tier ($800K+ MRR potential)
- Custom dashboard projects (Rp 3-8M)
- 5+ outlet multi-location customers
- API integration requests

**Sales Process:**
1. **Inbound Lead:** Customer requests upgrade or hits limit
2. **Discovery Call:** Understand needs (15-30 min, WhatsApp or Zoom)
3. **Demo:** Show Pro features solving their specific problems
4. **Proposal:** Custom pricing based on outlets, users, features needed
5. **Close:** Contract signed, onboarding scheduled

**Close Rate Target:** 40%+ of sales-assisted leads close

---

### Expansion Pricing Strategy

**Principle:** Make saying "yes" easy (small incremental cost for big value unlock)

**Good Upsell Pricing:**
- Lite Free → Lite Paid (Rp 200K): 0 → 200K (infinite % increase, but low absolute)
- Lite Paid → SaaS Basic (Rp 400K): +Rp 200K (2x, but unlocks team/cloud)
- SaaS Basic → Pro (Rp 1M): +Rp 600K (2.5x, but unlocks multi-outlet)

**Bad Upsell Pricing:**
- SaaS Basic (Rp 400K) → Pro (Rp 3M): 7.5x increase feels like punishment

**Rule:** Each tier should be 2-3x previous tier, not 5-10x

---

## Net Revenue Retention (NRR) Model

**NRR Formula:**
```
NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion MRR - Churn MRR) / Starting MRR

Example (100 customers at Rp 400K/mo = Rp 40M MRR):
Starting MRR: Rp 40M
+ Expansion: 20 customers upgrade (+Rp 600K avg) = +Rp 12M
- Churn: 10 customers cancel (-Rp 400K avg) = -Rp 4M
Ending MRR: Rp 48M

NRR = 48M / 40M = 120% ✅ (Excellent!)
```

**NRR Benchmarks:**
- 🔴 **<100%:** Danger (losing revenue even with new customers)
- 🟡 **100-110%:** Okay (expansion covers churn)
- 🟢 **110-120%:** Good (growth from existing customers)
- 🟦 **>120%:** Exceptional (best SaaS companies)

**Strategic Goal:** Achieve 110%+ NRR by Year 2 (expansion machine is working)

---

## Expansion Revenue Projections

### Year 1 (Foundation)
- **Focus:** Acquire customers, prove value
- **Expansion:** Minimal (most customers new, haven't hit limits yet)
- **NRR:** ~95-100% (slight churn, little expansion)

### Year 2 (Growth)
- **Focus:** Upsell Lite → SaaS, Basic → Pro
- **Expansion Revenue:** 20-30% of total MRR from upsells
- **NRR:** 105-115% (expansion starting to exceed churn)

### Year 3 (Scale)
- **Focus:** Systematic expansion playbook, sales team for high-touch
- **Expansion Revenue:** 40-50% of total MRR from upsells
- **NRR:** 115-125% (expansion machine firing on all cylinders)

## Expansion Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ **Don't:** Paywall basic features aggressively (free tier should be useful)  
✅ **Do:** Free tier solves Phase 1 problems, paid tier unlocks Phase 2 growth

❌ **Don't:** Force upgrades (dark patterns, fake limits)  
✅ **Do:** Natural limits aligned with business growth (30 days = Phase 1, 12 months = Phase 2)

❌ **Don't:** Surprise price jumps (Rp 400K → Rp 3M feels like punishment)  
✅ **Do:** Gradual tier increases (Rp 400K → Rp 800K → Rp 1.2M)

❌ **Don't:** Ignore non-upgraders (they're still valuable!)  
✅ **Do:** Keep delivering value, they might upgrade later (or refer others)

## Pillar 3 Integration with Other Pillars

**Pillar 1 (Acquisition) → Pillar 3:**
- Acquire Phase 1 customers cheap (freemium Lite)
- Expand them to Phase 2 (paid tiers) as they grow
- **Efficiency:** Low CAC + High expansion = Great unit economics

**Pillar 2 (Retention) → Pillar 3:**
- Must retain customers to expand them (can't upsell churned customers!)
- Longer tenure = more upgrade opportunities (Year 1 vs Year 3 customers)

**Pillar 3 + Pillar 4 (Defense):**
- Customers using more features = higher switching costs
- Multi-outlet users locked into platform (can't migrate 5 locations easily)

---

## Cultural Considerations (Indonesia)

**"Naik Kelas" Messaging:**
- Upgrades = status elevation, not price gouge
- Frame as: "You've graduated to the next level!" (celebrate growth)

**Soft Upsell:**
- Don't use aggressive popups or block features entirely
- Offer upgrade, but allow continued use if they decline (trust-based)

**Bundle Value:**
- Indonesians love bundles/packages ("paket hemat")
- Frame as: "Save Rp 125K/month with bundle!" (not "pay more")

**Annual Prepay:**
- Offer big discount for annual payment (cash flow preference)
- Example: Pay 10 months, get 12 months (17% discount)
