> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pillar Purpose:** **Acquisition** means getting customers in the door with low-friction entry points that generate immediate revenue while feeding the upgrade pipeline.

## Executive Summary

### What is Pillar 1 (Acquisition)?

**Pillar 1 products are designed to:**
1. **Attract new customers** with low barriers to entry  
2. **Generate immediate cash** (one-time sales, fast close cycles)  
3. **Feed the upgrade pipeline** to Pillar 2 (Retention), Pillar 3 (Expansion), and Pillar 5 (Core Platform)

**Not to be confused with:**
- ❌ **Marketing/Lead Gen** (that's top-of-funnel, before product)
- ❌ **Freemium/Free Trials** (those are Pillar 3 - Expansion tactics)

**Pillar 1 = First PAID touchpoint with lowest friction**

### Current Pillar 1 Portfolio

| Product | Type | Price | Status | Launch | Target Segment |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|----------------|
| **A1: Power BI Template Tier 1** | One-time purchase | Rp 3.5-4.7M | ACTIVE | Sprint 1 (Jan 2026) | Phase 2 SME (1-3 outlets) |
| **A2: Pay-Per-Insight Reports** | Micro-transaction | Rp 10-20K/report | Planned | Sprint 4 | Phase 1 Mikro (ad-hoc needs) |
| **A4a: Staff Scheduling Micro-SaaS** | Low-cost SaaS | Rp 50K/month | Planned | Sprint 5 | Phase 1 (single pain point) |
| **A4c: Loyalty Builder Micro-SaaS** | Low-cost SaaS | Rp 75K/month | Planned | Sprint 5 | Phase 2 (marketing-focused) |

**Revenue Target (Year 1):** Rp 300M (52% of total company revenue)

**Strategic Imperative:** Pillar 1 must deliver **fast cash** to self-fund Pillar 3→5 development (cloud infrastructure, SaaS platform)

---

## Part 1: Strategic Rationale

### Why Pillar 1 Exists

**Problem:** How do we get customers without requiring:
- Long sales cycles (enterprise takes 6-12 months)
- High upfront commitment (SaaS subscriptions scare Phase 1 Mikro)
- Behavior change (freemium requires daily usage before paying anything)

**Solution:** Offer **low-friction, high-value one-time products** that solve immediate pain

---

### Pillar 1 vs Other Pillars

| Pillar | Primary Goal | Customer Stage | Revenue Type | Friction Level |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Pillar 1: Acquisition** | Get new customers fast | First-time buyer | One-time / Micro-transaction | LOW (easy yes) |
| **Pillar 2: Retention** | Keep customers paying | Existing customer | Recurring (monthly) | MEDIUM (requires trust) |
| **Pillar 3: Expansion** | Grow account value | Engaged user | Upsell / Add-ons | MEDIUM (requires usage) |
| **Pillar 4: Defense** | Lock in customers | Long-term customer | Data/switching costs | HIGH (requires deep integration) |
| **Pillar 5: Core Platform** | Platform consolidation | Multi-product user | Subscription (MRR) | HIGH (requires commitment) |

**Pillar 1 Characteristics:**
- ✅ Self-serve (no sales calls required)
- ✅ Fast time-to-value (<24 hours aha moment)
- ✅ Low price (affordable for Phase 1-2)
- ✅ One-time payment (no subscription anxiety)
- ❌ Low customer lock-in (easy to abandon after purchase)
- ❌ No recurring revenue (must upsell to Pillar 2 for MRR)

## Part 2: Product A1 - Power BI Template (Flagship)

### Product Overview

**Strategic Role:** Primary revenue engine for Sprint 1-2, feeds Pillar 2/3 upgrade pipeline

**Target Customer:**
- **Persona:** Amanda (Phase 2 - Warung Naik Kelas)
- **Business:** 1-3 outlets, Rp 50-200M revenue/year

**Pricing:** Rp 3.5-4.7M one-time (avg Rp 4.5M)

**Value Proposition:**

- "One-time Rp 4.5M vs Rp 3M/month SaaS subscription"

## Part 3: Future Pillar 1 Products

### Product A2: Pay-Per-Insight Reports

**Launch:** Sprint 4 (Oct-Dec 2026)

**Problem:** Phase 1 Mikro can't afford Rp 4.5M dashboard but occasionally need specific insights

**Solution:** Micro-transaction reports (Rp 10-20K each)

**Examples:**
- "Menu Performance Report" (Rp 15K - which items most profitable?)
- "Peak Hours Heatmap" (Rp 10K - when to staff up?)
- "Customer Frequency Analysis" (Rp 20K - who are regulars vs one-timers?)

**Business Model:**
- Customer uploads 1 month POS data (Excel/CSV)
- We process via automated script (Python backend)
- Deliver PDF report in 24 hours

**Target Volume:** 100 reports/month x Rp 15K avg = Rp 1.5M/month (Rp 18M/year)

**Strategic Value:**
- **Low-friction entry** for Phase 1 (affordable experimentation)
- **Data collection** (upload POS data = we learn their schema, easier to sell full product later)
- **Upsell path:** "You ordered 5 reports this month (Rp 75K) - for Rp 50K/month get unlimited via Micro-SaaS"

---

### Product A4a-c: Micro-SaaS Point Solutions

**Launch:** Sprint 5+ (2027)

**Problem:** Full dashboard (A1 Tier 1) is overkill for single-pain-point needs

**Solution:** Unbundle dashboard into standalone micro-apps (Rp 25-75K/month each)

**Portfolio:**

| Micro-SaaS | Pain Point | Price | TAM |
|------------|------------|-------|-----|
| **A4a: Staff Scheduling** | "I never have enough staff during dinner rush" | Rp 50K/month | 50K F&B (labor-intensive) |
| **A4b: Menu Engineering** | "Which menu items should I promote vs kill?" | Rp 30K/month | 30K (menu complexity) |
| **A4c: Loyalty Builder** | "How do I make customers come back more?" | Rp 75K/month | 40K (repeat-biz focused) |
| **A4d: Supplier Tracker** | "I'm buying ingredients at wrong prices" | Rp 40K/month | 20K (procurement-heavy) |

**Why Micro-SaaS (Not Full SaaS)?**
- Lower price = lower friction (Phase 1 can afford Rp 50K, not Rp 500K)
- Focused value prop (solves ONE pain really well vs many pains poorly)
- Faster build (AI-codeable in 1-2 weeks each)
- Upsell path: "You're paying Rp 50K + Rp 30K + Rp 75K = Rp 155K for 3 micro-SaaS... for Rp 200K more get FULL platform (C1)"

**Target Revenue (Year 2):** 200 customers x Rp 50K avg x 12 months = Rp 120M

## Part 5: Pillar 1 Challenges & Mitigation

### Challenge 1: One-Time Revenue Volatility

**Problem:** Pillar 1 = lumpy cash flow (sell 10 in Jan, 2 in Feb, 15 in Mar = unpredictable)

**Impact:** Hard to plan expenses, runway pressure during slow months

**Mitigation:**
1. **Add Pillar 2 ASAP:** Launch R1 Support in Sprint 3 to start MRR
2. **Build pipeline:** Maintain 3x pipeline coverage (30 leads for 10 target sales)
3. **Seasonal planning:** F&B has seasonality (pre-Ramadan rush, post-Lebaran lull) - budget accordingly

---

### Challenge 2: Low Customer Lock-In

**Problem:** Pillar 1 customers can buy once and disappear (no recurring touchpoints)

**Impact:** High churn risk, no expansion revenue, have to constantly find NEW customers

**Mitigation:**
1. **Immediate Pillar 2 offer:** Upsell R1 support at point of sale (bundle: Tier 1 + 3mo support = Rp 5M)
2. **Engagement triggers:** Email sequence (Day 7: "How's setup going?", Day 30: "Ready for Tier 2?")
3. **Community building:** Facebook group for Tier 1 buyers (peer support = stickiness)

---

### Challenge 3: Pillar 1→2/3 Conversion Below Target

**Problem:** If only 10% convert Tier 1→Support (not 30% target), MRR suffers

**Impact:** Can't fund Sprint 2-3 cloud infrastructure, forced to stay in one-time revenue model

**Mitigation:**
1. **Pre-sprint validation:** During Sprint 1, test support offer with first 5 buyers (iterate messaging before scaling)
2. **Incentive alignment:** Sales comp includes conversion bonus (not just initial sale)
3. **Product-led conversion:** Build "Upgrade to Support" button directly in dashboard template

---

## Part 6: Competitive Positioning

### Pillar 1 vs Competitors

**Competitor 1: Generic BI Tools (Tableau, Looker)**

| **Metrics** | 30-50 F&B-specific | 5-10 generic |
| **Language** | Bahasa Indonesia | English (intimidating) |
| **Commitment** | One-time (low risk) | Annual contract (scary) |

**Positioning:** "Analytics for F&B, not tech companies. Pay once, not forever."

---

**Competitor 2: POS Built-In Analytics (Moka, Pawoon)**

| Dimension | Our Pillar 1 (A1) | Moka Analytics |

---

**Competitor 3: Freelance Dashboard Developers**
