- LTV by acquisition channel (which channels bring best customers?)

---

## Retention Economics

**Goal:** Maximize Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**LTV Calculation:**
```
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin %) / Churn Rate

Example (SaaS Basic):
ARPU = Rp 400K/month
Gross Margin = 80% (SaaS has high margins)
Churn Rate = 8%/month

LTV = (400K × 0.8) / 0.08 = Rp 4M

If we reduce churn to 5%:
LTV = (400K × 0.8) / 0.05 = Rp 6.4M (+60% improvement!)
```

**ROI of Retention:**
- 5% reduction in churn = 25-95% increase in profits (Harvard Business Review)
- Acquiring a new customer costs 5-25x more than retaining existing one
- Increasing retention by 5% can increase profits by 25-95%

**Investment Priority:** Retention > Acquisition (once you have product-market fit)

---

## Pillar 2 Integration with Other Pillars

**Pillar 1 (Acquisition) → Pillar 2:**
- Template buyers (A1) → Template Support (R1) conversion
- Lite Dashboard users (E1) → Upgrade to SaaS Basic (retaining free users)

**Pillar 2 → Pillar 3 (Expansion):**
- R2a users → Upsell R2b+R2c bundle
- SaaS Basic users → Upgrade to SaaS Pro (retention enables expansion)

**Pillar 2 + Pillar 4 (Defense):**
- Longer customer tenure → More proprietary data → Switching cost increases
- Retention creates data moats (see [[biz/strategy/planning/pillars/04-defense|Pillar 4]])

---

## Cultural Considerations (Indonesia)

**WhatsApp-First Support:**
- Indonesians prefer WhatsApp over email (instant, personal)
- Voice notes acceptable (don't force text-only)

**Soft Retention:**
- Don't use aggressive "Are you sure?" dark patterns (backfires)
- Allow easy cancellation via WhatsApp (builds trust)
- "Naik kelas" messaging (retention = growth, not punishment)

**Relationship Over Transaction:**
- Personal check-ins, not just automated emails
- Remember customer details (business name, outlets, goals)
- Celebrate milestones ("1 year with us!")
