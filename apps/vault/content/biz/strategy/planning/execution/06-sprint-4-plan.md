## Sprint 4 Metrics

| Metric | Sprint 3 Actual | Sprint 4 Target |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Revenue** | Rp 300M | Rp 250M |
| **Customers** | 100 | 130 |
| **MRR** | Rp 1.5M | Rp 2.5M |
| **Product Mix** | Template-heavy | More diversified |
| **Lite Users** | 0 | 100 (free) |

---

## Sprint 4 Gates

**Gate 5 (Mid-Sprint, Month 11):**
- Lite: 50+ downloads (validate interest)
- Custom: 1 pilot project delivered (validate capability)
- Template: On track for 30 sales

**Gate 6 (End Sprint 4, Month 12):**
- Lite: 30% activation (validates Phase 1 engagement)
- Custom: 2 projects completed, customers happy (NPS >8)
- Total revenue: >Rp 600M cumulative (Year 1 target)
- **Decide:** Proceed to Year 2 (SaaS scale) OR pivot

---

## Sprint 4 Pivot Scenarios

**If Lite Fails (<10% activation):**
- Action: Shelve free product, focus on paid (Template/SaaS)
- Rationale: Phase 1 not ready for analytics tools

**If Custom Dashboard Fails (customers unhappy, NPS <6):**
- Action: Don't offer custom services, focus on scalable products
- Rationale: Services don't scale, distract from product

**If Overall Revenue Miss (<Rp 150M this sprint):**
- Action: Extend to 5 months before Sprint 5, double down on Template sales
- Rationale: Not ready for major SaaS investment yet

---

## Sprint 4 Team

**Team Size:** 3-4 people  
**Roles:**
- Founder (sales, strategy, custom projects)
- Product Lead (Lite development, feature roadmap)
- CS Specialist (support 100+ customers)
- **(Optional) Contractor:** Frontend dev for Lite (3-month contract)

---

## Sprint 4 Learnings to Capture

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Will Phase 1 Mikro use free analytics? (Lite validation)
2. Can we deliver custom dashboards profitably? (Margin analysis)
3. What's optimal CAC for paid ads? (Marketing efficiency)
4. What features do enterprise customers need? (SaaS roadmap input)

**Documentation:**
- Sprint 4 Retrospective (what worked, what didn't)
- Customer research summary (Lite user interviews)
- Custom Dashboard case studies (for future sales)

---

**Status:** PLANNED  
**Pre-Requisite:** Sprint 2-3 success  
**Review:** Mid-Sprint 3 (adjust based on learnings)
