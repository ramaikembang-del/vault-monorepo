# Sprint 1 Roadmap: Foundation Launch
**Comprehensive Execution Plan - Weeks 1-4**

**Timeline:** January - March 2026  
**Status:** ACTIVE - Week 0 (Pre-Launch)  
**Purpose:** Execute optimal 3-product foundation (Template + Support + Lite) to establish revenue, validation, and strategic positioning

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core Hypothesis:** Can we achieve both immediate revenue (Template) AND foundational validation (Lite) in parallel, while building recurring revenue capability (Support)?

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 1 launches **3 products across 3 pillars** to simultaneously address revenue, validation, and strategic positioning needs.

| Product | Pillar | Revenue Target | Validation Goal | Build Time |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **A1: Power BI Template** | P1 (Acquisition) | Rp 20-50M | Phase 2 willingness-to-pay | 1-2 weeks |
| **R1: Template Support** | P2 (Retention) | Rp 225-450K MRR | Subscription conversion rate | 1-2 days |
| **E1: Web Dashboard Lite** | P3 (Expansion) | Rp 0 (Freemium) | Phase 1 engagement with analytics | 2 weeks |

**Success Metrics:**
- 💰 **Revenue:** Rp 20-50M one-time + Rp 225K+ MRR
- 👥 **Users:** 5+ Template sales, 50+ Lite freemium users
- 📊 **Validation:** 30%+ Support conversion, 20%+ Lite engagement

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why These 3 Products?

**Derived from [[biz/strategy/planning/execution/01-product-roadmap|8-Step Prioritization Framework]]:**

1. **E1 scored 18/21** - Highest priority for validation (answers foundational question: "Will Phase 1 Mikro engage?")
2. **A1 scored 17/21** - Fastest path to revenue (Rp 20-50M in 2 weeks, 50% already built)
3. **R1 scored 14/21** - Begins recurring revenue immediately (only 1-2 days to build)

**Alternative Sequences Rejected:**
- ❌ **Template Only:** No Pillar 3→5 pipeline, can't justify SaaS investment
- ❌ **Lite Only:** No revenue, can't fund Sprint 2 infrastructure
- ❌ **Micro-SaaS Focus:** Fragments effort, doesn't test platform hypothesis

### Week 0 Constraints

| Constraint | Reality | Impact on Sprint 1 |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Budget** | Bootstrapped, minimal runway | Must generate revenue to fund Sprint 2 cloud infra |
| **Capability** | AI-coding, Power BI skills | Can build A1 (50% done), E1 (AI-codeable), R1 (simple) |
| **Time** | 2-3 month runway pressure | Need BOTH validation AND revenue, not either/or |
| **Dependencies** | None available | Full SaaS blocked until Lite validates demand |

**Why This Combo Works:**
- Template revenue funds Sprint 2 cloud infrastructure
- Lite validation unlocks Sprint 3 Full SaaS investment
- Support starts recurring revenue immediately (proves subscription viability)

- Currently using paper/WhatsApp, no systematic tracking

**Pricing:**  
- **Phase 1 (Sprint 1):** Free forever (validation focus)

**Gate 1 Criteria (Week 4):**  
- 50+ downloads
- 10+ active users (used 3+ days)
- 5+ user interviews completed

**Strategic Importance:**  
- **Unblocks Full SaaS:** Can't justify Sprint 3 SaaS investment without confirming Phase 1 actually engages

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Template Sales Below Target

**Likelihood:** Medium (cold start, no brand)  
**Impact:** High (no Sprint 2 funding)

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-sales validation (Week 0): Confirm 3+ verbal commitments
- Warm network first (higher conversion)
- Offer early-access discount (Rp 3.5M vs Rp 4.5M)
- Flexible pricing (Rp 3.5-6M based on business size)

**Contingency:**  
If Week 2 shows \<2 sales, extend Sprint 1 by 2 weeks OR lower price to Rp 2.5M

---

### Risk 2: Lite Fails to Engage Phase 1

**Likelihood:** Medium (Phase 1 = low tech adoption)  
**Impact:** High (invalidates SaaS strategy)

**Mitigation:**
- Hand-hold first 10 beta users (WhatsApp support)
- Simplify UI to bare minimum (3 fields: revenue, expense, profit)
- Offline-first (no internet required)
- Indonesian UI (Bahasa, not English)

**Contingency:**  
If Week 4 shows \<10 active users, iterate to Phase 2 SME target instead (Amanda/Budi) with desktop app

---

### Risk 3: Support Conversion Below 30%

**Likelihood:** Low (natural upsell)  
**Impact:** Medium (less MRR but not critical)

**Mitigation:**
- Bundle incentive (Rp 5M = Template + 6mo Support)
- First month free trial (converts after delivery)
- Highlight value (free updates, priority support)

**Contingency:**  
If \<20% convert, OK - still validates subscription willingness, just at lower rate

---

### Risk 4: Time Overrun (Can't Build 3 Products)

**Likelihood:** Medium (solo execution risk)  
**Impact:** Medium (delays Sprint 2)

**Mitigation:**
- AI-code Lite (reduce build time from 4 weeks → 2 weeks)
- Support is 1-2 days only (minimal feature set)
- Template already 50% done (only polish needed)

**Contingency:**  
If behind schedule, ship Lite as closed beta only (10 users, manual onboarding)

---

## Sprint 2 Preview (Conditional Launch)

**If Gate 2 Passes:**

**Products:**
- E1-P2: Lite Phase 2 (paid tier Rp 50-75K/mo with 12-month history, multi-location)
- R2c: COGS/HPP Calculator (Pillar 2 expansion)
- R2a: Simple P&L Tracker

**Budget Unlocked:**  
Rp 20M+ from Sprint 1 revenue → Can afford Supabase Pro, cloud hosting

**Strategic Shift:**  
From validation → monetization (convert Lite freemium to paid)
