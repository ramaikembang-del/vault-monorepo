3. **Defend:** Lock-in with data moats, custom integrations, enterprise features

---

## Part 1: Four-Pillar Strategy Framework

### Pillar 1: Acquisition (Get Customers)

**Goal:** Build awareness, generate leads, convert first-time buyers

**Products in This Pillar:**

| Product ID | Product Name | Status | Price | Target Audience |
|-----------|--------------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **A2** | Free F&B Metrics Calculator (Excel) | Planned Sprint 2 | Free (lead magnet) | Phase 1-2 F&B (awareness stage) |
| **A3** | Webinar: "F&B Analytics 101" | Planned Sprint 3 | Free | F&B owners (education → sales funnel) |

**Strategy:**
- Free tools = lead generation (capture emails)
- Educational content = build trust
- Convert free users to paid Product 01 (Tier 1)

---

### Pillar 2: Conversion (First Purchase)

**Goal:** Convert leads to paying customers (land the account)

**Products in This Pillar:**

| Product ID | Product Name | Status | Price | Conversion Goal |
|-----------|--------------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **C1** | Power BI Template - Tier 1 Essentials | Active (Alpha 0.1) | Rp 3.5-4.7M | First-time buyer entry point |

**Strategy:**
- Low barrier to entry (Tier 1 = cheapest option)
- High success rate (92% setup success)
- Fast time-to-value (<24h aha moment)
- Creates "stickiness" (once they use dashboard daily, hard to leave)

---

### Pillar 3: Expansion (Grow Revenue)

**Goal:** Upsell existing customers, increase lifetime value

**Products in This Pillar:**

| Product ID | Product Name | Status | Price | Expansion Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **E1** | Power BI Template - Tier 2 Professional | Planned Beta 0.1 (Jan 2026) | Rp 7-9.5M | Upgrade from Tier 1 (+70 metrics, multi-outlet) |
| **E2** | Power BI Template - Tier 3 Enterprise | Planned Beta 0.3 (May 2026) | Rp 10-19.8M | Upgrade from Tier 2 (+enterprise features, white-label) |
| **E3** | Template Support (Product 02) | Planned Beta 0.3 | Rp 400K-2M/month | Add recurring revenue (ongoing support) |
| **E4** | Add-On Modules | Planned v1.0 | +Rp 1.25M each | Cross-sell (Menu Engineering, Forecasting, etc.) |
| **E5** | Custom Dashboard (Product 06) | Planned Sprint 4 | Rp 25-50M | For customers outgrowing templates |

**Strategy:**
- Natural upgrade path (Tier 1 → 2 → 3)
- Recurring revenue lock-in (Product 02 ongoing support)
- Modularity (add-ons increase ACV without full tier upgrade)

---

### Pillar 4: Defense (Retain Customers)

**Goal:** Prevent churn, lock in customers, create switching costs

**Products in This Pillar:**

| Product ID | Product Name | Status | Price | Defense Mechanism |
|-----------|--------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **D1** | Data Moats (proprietary insights) | Planned v2.0 | Included | More data in system = harder to switch |
| **D2** | POS Direct Integration | Planned v1.0 | Included (Tier 3) | API integration = switching cost |
| **D3** | SaaS Basic (Product 05) | Planned v2.0 | Rp 500K-2M/month | Cloud-hosted, auto-refresh (subscription lock-in) |
| **D4** | SaaS Enterprise (Product 13) | Planned v3.0 | Rp 5M+/month | Full custom solution, contract lock-in |

**Strategy:**
- Data accumulation (customer's historical data trapped in our system)
- Integration depth (API connections make switching painful)
- Subscription model (monthly payments = committed revenue)
- Customization (bespoke features create dependency)

---

## Part 2: Product Portfolio Matrix

### 2.1 BCG Matrix (Boston Consulting Group)

**Framework:** Classify products by market growth vs market share

```
 High Market Share →

High STARS QUESTION
Growth MARKS
Rate ↓ Invest $$ Test &
 Decide

Low CASH COWS DOGS
Growth
Rate Milk for $ Divest/
 Kill

 Low Market Share ← High Market Share
```

**Our Portfolio (Current State):**

| Quadrant | Products | Strategy |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **STARS** | Product 01 Tier 1 (high growth market, gaining share fast) | Invest heavily in Sprint 1-2, scale sales team |
| **QUESTION MARKS** | Product 03 Web Dashboard Lite (high growth potential, unproven), Product 06 Custom Dashboard | Test in Sprint 3-4, decide invest vs kill |
| **CASH COWS** | (None yet - need mature products first) | Future: Tier 3 + Product 02 ongoing support becomes cash cow |
| **DOGS** | (None - all products are new/planned) | Future: Kill underperforming products |

---

### 2.2 Product Lifecycle Map

**Where Each Product Sits:**

```
Introduction → Growth → Maturity → Decline

Product 01 Tier 1: Introduction → Growth (Sprint 1-2)
Product 02 Support: Introduction (Sprint 3)
Products 03-13: Not launched yet (planned)
```

**Lifecycle Strategy:**

**Introduction (Product 01 Tier 1 - Now):**
- Goal: Achieve product-market fit
- Focus: Customer validation, iterate fast
- Metrics: Setup success %, NPS, payback period
- Investment: High (develop product, educate market)

**Growth (Product 01 - Year 1-2):**
- Goal: Scale customer acquisition
- Focus: Sales & marketing, channel partnerships
- Metrics: Monthly new customers, CAC, LTV
- Investment: Moderate (scale team, marketing spend)

**Maturity (Product 01 - Year 3+):**
- Goal: Maximize profit, defend market share
- Focus: Operational efficiency, retention
- Metrics: Gross margin %, customer retention %, market share
- Investment: Low (milk cash, optimize costs)

**Decline (None yet):**
- Goal: Gracefully sunset or pivot
- Strategy: Migrate customers to newer products, stop new sales

## Part 4: Portfolio Strategy

### 4.1 Sequencing Logic

**Why This Order?**

**Sprint 1 (Jan-Mar 2026): Product 01 Tier 1 Only**
- Rationale: Prove product-market fit with simplest version
- Focus: 100 customers, Rp 470M revenue
- Learn: Setup success, customer usage, payback period

**Sprint 2 (Apr-Jun 2026): Add Tier 2**
- Rationale: Serve multi-outlet segment (demand validated in beta)
- Revenue: +Rp 300M (from Tier 2 sales + Tier 1 continues)
- Learn: Multi-outlet consolidation, upgrade path (T1→T2)

**Sprint 3 (Jul-Sep 2026): Add Product 02 Support + Tier 3**
- Rationale: Capture recurring revenue, serve enterprise
- Revenue: +Rp 200M (Tier 3 one-time) + Rp 10M/month recurring (Product 02)
- Learn: Ongoing support model, enterprise sales cycle

**Sprint 4 (Oct-Dec 2026): Launch Product 03 Web Dashboard**
- Rationale: Platform diversification, Mac/mobile access

---

### 4.2 Portfolio Gaps & Opportunities

**Current Gaps:**

**Gap 1: No Recurring Revenue (Sprint 1-2)**
- Risk: All revenue is one-time (lumpy cash flow)
- Mitigation: Launch Product 02 in Sprint 3 (add MRR)
- Target: 20% of revenue from recurring by Year 2

**Gap 2: No Free/Low-Cost Lead Magnet**
- Risk: High customer acquisition cost (no top-of-funnel)
- Mitigation: Create Product A2 (Free Excel Calculator) in Sprint 2
- Target: 1,000 downloads/month → 5% conversion to Product 01 = 50 leads/month

**Gap 3: Windows-Only Limitation**
- Risk: Can't serve Mac users (30% of TAM excluded)
- Mitigation: Product 03 Web Dashboard (browser-based)
- Target: Capture 10% of Mac user segment (3,000 customers)

**Gap 4: No Enterprise-Grade Offering (Sprint 1-2)**
- Risk: Can't serve 10+ outlet chains, corporate F&B
- Mitigation: Product 06 Custom Dashboard (high-touch service)
- Target: 5 enterprise customers/year @ Rp 35M avg = Rp 175M

## Part 5: Competitive Portfolio Response

### 5.1 Defensive Product Strategy

**Scenario 1: Competitor Launches Cheaper Template (Rp 2M)**

**Our Response:**
- Don't compete on price (race to bottom)
- Emphasize value: "92% setup success vs their 40%", "F&B-specific vs generic"
- Launch Product A2 (Free Calculator) → compete on free tier, convert to premium

**Portfolio Adjustment:** Accelerate free lead magnet launch

---

**Scenario 2: POS Vendor (Moka) Builds Advanced Analytics**

**Our Response:**
- Partner, don't compete (co-sell: "Works seamlessly with Moka")
- Differentiate: "We work with ALL POS, not just Moka" (multi-POS aggregation)
- Offer white-label Product 06 to Moka (we build, they resell)

**Portfolio Adjustment:** Prioritize POS partnerships over direct competition

---

**Scenario 3: Enterprise BI (Tableau) Targets SME F&B**

**Our Response:**
- Emphasize affordability: "Rp 4.7M one-time vs Rp 3M/month subscription"
- Target mid-market (Tableau goes upmarket, we own 1-5 outlet segment)
- Bundle Products 01 + 02 + 06 (complete solution at Tableau pricing = better deal)

**Portfolio Adjustment:** No change (Tableau unlikely to go downmarket seriously)
