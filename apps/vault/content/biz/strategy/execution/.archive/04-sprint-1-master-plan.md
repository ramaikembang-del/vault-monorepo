# Sprint 1 Master Plan
**Hybrid Validation-First Strategy: 3 Products in Parallel**

**Timeline:** Weeks 1-4
**Products:** Power BI Template + Template Support + Web Dashboard Lite
**Goal:** Fast revenue (template) + Validation (Lite) + Recurring revenue (support)

> [!NOTE]
> **Cultural Context:** Sprint 1 execution must align with Indonesian market realities documented in [[biz/strategy/market-analysis/02-cultural-context|Cultural Context]]:
> - **WhatsApp-first support** — Configure WhatsApp Business before launch (not email)
> - **Community validation** — Marketing via Facebook groups, paguyuban, not cold outreach
> - **Protection messaging** — "Lindungi bisnis Anda" framing, not "Grow 10x"
> - **Neutral mediator UX** — Lite Dashboard shows data without blame language

---

## Executive Summary

**The Strategy:**
Launch 3 products simultaneously to balance fast revenue with low-risk validation:

1. **Power BI Template** (finish + launch Week 2) → Rp 20-50M one-time revenue
2. **Template Support** (build + launch Week 2) → Rp 225-450K MRR
3. **Web Dashboard Lite** (MVP Week 1-2, validate Week 4) → Engagement validation

**Why Parallel?**
- Template generates cash NOW (no validation delay)
- Lite validates PMF cheaply (low-risk learning)
- Support creates recurring revenue stream
- AI-coding enables parallel development

**Risk Mitigation:**
- 3 validation gates (Week 2, Week 4)
- If any product fails → Pivot quickly
- Total investment: 4 weeks, not months

- 60% Template (finish 50% → 100%)
- 30% Lite MVP (AI-code 6 features)
- 10% Support (simple setup)

**Week 2:**
- 50% Template (polish + launch)

---

## Revenue Projections

### **Conservative Scenario**
- Template: 10 sales × Rp 2M = **Rp 20M one-time**
- Support: 3 subscribers × Rp 75K = **Rp 225K MRR**
- Lite: 0 revenue (freemium validation)
- **Total Week 4:** Rp 20.225M

### **Optimistic Scenario**
- Template: 20 sales × Rp 2.5M = **Rp 50M one-time**
- Support: 6 subscribers × Rp 75K = **Rp 450K MRR**
- Lite: 0 revenue (freemium validation)
- **Total Week 4:** Rp 50.450M

**Goal:** Rp 20-50M revenue + PMF validation in 4 weeks

---

## Dependencies & Risks

### **Product Dependencies**

**Template → Support:**
- Support can't launch without template buyers
- If template fails, support is irrelevant

**Template/Support → Lite:**
- Independent products, can launch in parallel
- Lite doesn't depend on template success

**Lite → Future Products:**
- Lite data informs Full SaaS features
- If Lite fails, Full SaaS roadmap unclear

### **Critical Risks**

**Risk 1: Template doesn't sell (<5 in Week 2)**
- **Impact:** No revenue, support subscribers = 0
- **Mitigation:** Lower price, refund buyers, focus on Lite

**Risk 2: Lite users don't engage (<30% daily use)**
- **Impact:** Can't validate PMF, Full SaaS uncertain
- **Mitigation:** Fix UX, extend validation period

**Risk 3: Building 3 products stretches capacity**
- **Impact:** Poor quality, missed deadlines
- **Mitigation:** AI-coding accelerates, simple MVP scope

## Sprint 2 Decision Matrix

**Based on Week 4 Gate Results:**

| Template | Lite | Support | Sprint 2 Action |
|----------|------|---------|-----------------|
| Pass | Pass | Pass | **Best case:** Build Lite Phase 2 + Scale template sales |
| Pass | Pass | Fail | Build Lite Phase 2, make support free |
| Pass | Fail | Pass | Fix Lite UX, continue template/support |
| Fail | Pass | Fail | Pivot to Lite only, refund template buyers |
| Fail | Fail | Fail | **Worst case:** All products failed → Re-evaluate entire strategy |

**Most Likely Scenario:** Template passes, Lite needs iteration, Support TBD
