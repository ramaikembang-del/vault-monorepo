## OKR Best Practices

**Writing Good Objectives:**
- Inspirational: "Delight customers with best-in-class product"
- Boring: "Improve product quality"

**Writing Good Key Results:**
- Specific: "Achieve NPS >50 "
- Vague: "Improve customer satisfaction"
- Measurable: "Launch 3 major features"
- Unmeasurable: "Build better features"

**Ambitious but Achievable:**
- Target: 70% achievement = success
- 100% achievement = OKRs weren't ambitious enough
- <50% achievement = OKRs were unrealistic

## Weekly Check-ins

**Every Monday:** Review OKR progress
- Green: On track (>70% confidence)
- Yellow: At risk (50-70% confidence)
- Red: Off track (<50% confidence)

**If Red:** Discuss mitigation plan or revise OKR
