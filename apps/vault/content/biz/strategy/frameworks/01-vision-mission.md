## Mission Statement

**Democratize data-driven decision-making for Indonesian F&B businesses.**

We empower every food & beverage owner - from warung to restaurant chains - with affordable, accessible analytics tools that transform raw operational data into actionable business insights.

---

## Vision Statement

**By 2030, every F&B owner in Indonesia makes decisions powered by their own data.**

We envision a future where:
- **Phase 1 Mikro** operators track daily cash flow without spreadsheets
- **Phase 2-3 Kecil** owners optimize inventory and labor costs confidently
- **Phase 4-5 Enterprise** chains leverage predictive analytics for expansion

From solo warung owners to multi-outlet chains, analytics becomes a competitive advantage, not a luxury.

## Core Values

### 1. **Accessibility First**
Break down technical and financial barriers to analytics adoption.
- Pricing starts at Rp 50K/month (accounting modules)
- Free tier validates the market (Web Dashboard Lite)
- Offline-first design for poor internet connectivity

### 2. **Smart Solo to Partnership**
Build sustainable, agile teams without bloat.
- "2-Person Founding Team" structure
- Co-founder model for first hire (Operations Partner)
- Leverage AI and automation before hiring humans

### 3. **Ecosystem Over Feature**
Create a product portfolio where each offering reinforces the others.
- **5 Strategic Pillars**: Acquisition  ->  Retention  ->  Expansion  ->  Defense  ->  Core
- **22-Product Roadmap** with gated sprints
- Natural upgrade paths from free tools to enterprise SaaS

### 4. **Validation-Driven Development**
Ship fast, measure rigorously, iterate relentlessly.
- Sprint gates with clear KPIs (e.g., "5+ sales in Week 2")
- AI-coded MVPs for rapid validation (Web Dashboard Lite)
- Kill underperforming products early (30-day evaluation windows)

### 5. **Indonesian Context-Native**
Design for local business realities, not Silicon Valley assumptions.
- Cash-based accounting ("Kas Masuk/Keluar")
- WhatsApp-first sharing (invoices, reports)
- Rupiah pricing without USD conversion complexity

## Strategic Anchors

### North Star Metric
**Monthly Active Analytics Users (MAAU)**
Measures genuine engagement, not just purchases.

### 3-Year Target (2029)
- **1,000+ paying customers** across all product tiers
- **Rp 500M+ ARR** (Annual Recurring Revenue)
- **<30% churn rate** on SaaS subscriptions
- **10+ team members** (from solo to functional departments)

### Brand Promise
*"Your POS has the data. We make it speak."*

We don't replace POS systems - we integrate with them (Pawoon, Moka, Majoo) to surface insights that were always there, just invisible.
