## D1: Power BI Consulting Firms in Indonesia

- **Pricing:** Rp 150-400M per project

## D2: SaaS Competitors (Potential Future Entrants)

### Global Players (Could Enter Indonesia)

#### 1. **Toast POS** (USA)
- **Current Status:** POS + basic reporting
- **Risk:** Could add advanced analytics module
- **Entry Timeline:** 12-18 months (if they prioritize Indonesia)
- **Our Mitigation:**
 - Deeper F&B analytics (they focus on POS)
 - Local support (WhatsApp, Bahasa Indonesia)
 - Indonesian payment integrations (GoPay/OVO)
 - Lower pricing (we're 30-50% cheaper)
- **Threat Level:** Medium-High (strong brand, but not Indonesia-focused)

#### 2. **Lightspeed** (Canada)
- **Current Status:** POS for restaurants with analytics module
- **Risk:** Has analytics capability, could localize
- **Entry Timeline:** 18-24 months
- **Our Mitigation:**
 - Not Indonesia-focused (no Bahasa, no local support)
 - Expensive (enterprise pricing)
 - Complex setup (we're simpler)
- **Threat Level:** Medium (capability exists but unlikely to prioritize Indonesia)

#### 3. **7shifts** (Canada)
- **Current Status:** Staff scheduling platform
- **Risk:** Could expand to full analytics
- **Entry Timeline:** 24+ months (pivot required)
- **Our Mitigation:**
 - Scheduling-focused (not full analytics dashboard)

### Local Potential Entrants

#### 1. **Pawoon / Moka**

- **Risk:** Could build advanced analytics module
- **Entry Timeline:** 12-18 months (if they decide to invest)
- **Our Strategy:**
 - **Partner first** (referral deals)
 - **Co-opetition** (we enhance their POS, not replace)
 - **Integration advantage** (we work WITH all POSes, not just one)
- **Our Mitigation:**
 - They want to focus on POS core business (not analytics)
 - Building deep analytics requires different expertise
 - We integrate with them (win-win)
- **Threat Level:** Medium (capability, but partnership likely)

#### 2. **Qasir / Olsera**
- **Current Status:** Cloud POS for SME
- **Risk:** Low (small teams, focused on core product)
- **Entry Timeline:** 24+ months (resource-constrained)
- **Our Mitigation:**
 - Same partnership approach as Pawoon/Moka
 - They lack engineering resources for deep analytics
 - Integration partnership benefits both sides
- **Threat Level:** Low (too small to compete)

### Competitive Assessment Summary

**18-24 Month Window:** First-mover advantage critical
**Win Strategy:**
1. Build 100+ customer base before global players enter
2. Partnership deals with Pawoon/Moka/Qasir (co-opt potential local competitors)
3. Strong customer relationships (WhatsApp support = high switching cost)
4. Continuous innovation (monthly feature releases stay ahead)

### A1 Battle Cards (Sales Enablement)

#### Battle Card #1: vs Power BI Freelancers

**Customer Objection:** *"I can hire a freelancer for custom work."*

**Our Response (3-step):**

1. **Acknowledge:** "Freelancers offer custom solutions, and that flexibility is valuable."

2. **Differentiate:**
 - **Speed:** "Our template is ready in 1 week vs 4-12 weeks for custom. You start seeing insights this month, not in 3 months."
 - **Quality:** "Freelancer quality varies. Our template has been tested with 50+ F&B businesses. You get proven metrics, not experimental work."
 - **Support:** "Freelancers disappear after delivery. We offer R1 ongoing support (Rp 75K/mo) for updates, troubleshooting, new features."

3. **Close:** "Try our Tier 1 DIY (Rp 2M). If you need custom work later, we can do Tier 2 Assisted (Rp 6M) - still 5× cheaper than freelancers."

**Win Triggers:**
- Customer scaling fast (needs solution ASAP)
- Had bad freelancer experience (quality issues)
- Values ongoing partnership (not one-and-done)

---

#### Battle Card #2: vs DIY Excel

**Customer Objection:** *"Excel is free, why pay Rp 2M?"*

**Our Response (3-step):**

1. **Acknowledge:** "Excel works for simple tracking, and it's free. Many of our customers started with Excel."

2. **Calculate Time Cost:**
 - "How many hours/week do you spend on Excel? 5 hours? 10 hours?"
 - "At Rp 100K/hour (your time value), that's Rp 500K-1M/week = **Rp 2-4M/month** in time."
 - "Our template costs Rp 2M **one-time**. It pays for itself in **1-2 months** through time savings alone."

3. **Differentiate:**
 - **Automation:** "POS auto-sync. No manual data entry. Save 10-20 hours/month."
 - **Multi-outlet:** "Excel breaks when you scale to 2-3 outlets. Our template handles 10+ outlets in one view."
 - **Insights:** "Excel shows what happened. Our template shows **why** (trend analysis, benchmarks, forecasts)."

4. **Risk Reversal:** "If you don't save 10+ hours/month in the first 30 days, we'll refund 100%."

**Win Triggers:**
- Operator values time over money
- Multi-outlet operator (Excel consolidation nightmare)
- Scaling ambitions (knows Excel won't scale)

**When We Win:**
- Time-critical issues (need fast answers)
- Ongoing evolution (business changing, metrics evolving)
- Non-technical operator (needs hand-holding)
- Values relationship (wants partner, not transactional help)

---

#### Competitor 2: Hiring In-House BI Analyst (Expensive Alternative)

**Examples:**
- Junior BI Analyst: Rp 6-8M/month salary
- Senior BI Analyst: Rp 10-15M/month salary
- Plus overhead (employment benefits, equipment, training)

**Competitive Comparison:**

| Factor | In-House Analyst | R1 Subscription (Us) | **Our Advantage** |

### R1 Battle Card (Sales Enablement)

#### Battle Card: vs "I'll just Google/ask forums"

**Customer Objection:** *"I can find answers online for free."*

**Our Response (3-step):**

1. **Acknowledge:** "Forums are great for generic Power BI questions. Many of our customers use them too."

2. **Time Value:**
 - "How many hours/month do you spend searching forums? 2 hours? 5 hours?"
 - "At Rp 100K/hour (your time value), that's Rp 200K-500K/month in time."
 - "R1 is Rp 75K/month. You **save 2-5 hours/month** = net positive even before quality improvement."

3. **Differentiate:**
 - **F&B-Specific:** "Forums give generic answers. We know F&B. Example: 'How to track Food Cost %?' Forum says 'use DAX formula'. We say 'Here's the exact metric for Indonesian F&B suppliers, tested with 100+ restaurants, accounts for waste, FIFO rotation, and seasonal pricing'."
 - **WhatsApp Speed:** "Forums = wait 6-48 hours. WhatsApp = \u003c24 hours, often same day."
 - **Template Updates:** "We add new metrics monthly. Forums don't update your template - you implement manually."

4. **Close:** "Try 3 months free (worth Rp 225K). After that, Rp 75K/month - less than 1 hour of your time."

**Win Triggers:**
- Time-starved operator (values speed)
- Non-technical (intimidated by forums)
- Business evolving fast (needs frequent template updates)
- Already frustrated with forum quality/speed

### E1 Battle Cards (Sales Enablement)

#### Battle Card #1: vs Moka Analytics

**Customer Objection:** *"We already use Moka POS, their analytics is free upgrade."*

**Our Response (3-step):**

1. **Acknowledge:** "Moka has good basic reporting, and many of our customers started there."

2. **Differentiate (3 key points):**
 - **Mobile-First:** "Check your dashboard from your phone, anywhere, anytime. Moka requires desktop login. You're out buying supplies? Check Food Cost % from your phone with E1."
 - **Offline Access:** "E1 works offline (no internet needed). Moka requires connection. Your warung has spotty internet? E1 still works."
 - **Price:** "E1 Starter is Rp 200K/month. Moka Analytics is Rp 300K. Save Rp 100K/month = **Rp 1.2M/year**."

3. **Trial:** "Try E1 Free tier (7 days history, 5 metrics) **alongside** Moka for 1 month. See which you prefer. No commitment."

**Win Triggers:**
- Customer travels frequently (mobile access critical)
- Unreliable internet at business location
- Budget-conscious (Rp 1.2M/year savings matters)
- Frustrated with Moka's desktop-only experience

---

#### Battle Card #2: vs "Excel is good enough"

**Customer Objection:** *"I track everything in Excel already."*

**Our Response (3-step):**

1. **Acknowledge:** "Excel works for basic sales tracking. It's what everyone starts with."

2. **Time Cost:**
 - "How much time/day on Excel? 30 minutes? 1 hour?"
 - "At 1 hour/day × 30 days = **30 hours/month**. Your time is worth at least Rp 50K/hour (minimum wage). That's Rp 1.5M/month in time cost."
 - "E1 Starter is Rp 200K/month. **Saves you 25+ hours/month**. That's Rp 1.25M net profit in time saved."

3. **Mobile Advantage:**
 - "With Excel, you can't check reports on your phone (unless you carry laptop everywhere)."
 - "With E1, you check dashboard while commuting, shopping, anywhere. Example: You're at supplier, see Food Cost % is high → negotiate better price **right now**, not next week after Excel analysis."

4. **Free Trial:** "Try E1 Free (no credit card). 7 days history, 5 metrics. See if you save time. If not, stay with Excel - no hard feelings."

**Win Triggers:**
- Time-starved (working 12-14 hour days)
- Mobile lifestyle (rarely at desk)
- Scaling (2nd outlet opening soon - Excel won't scale)
- Tech-curious (wants to try new tools)

---

#### Battle Card #3: vs Kledo/Jurnal (Accounting Software)

**Customer Objection:** *"We use Kledo for accounting, why need another tool?"*

**Our Response (3-step):**

1. **Acknowledge:** "Kledo is great for accounting compliance - invoices, expenses, reports. We're not replacing that."

2. **Complementary Use Case:**
 - "Kledo answers: 'What's my P&L?' (backward-looking accounting)"
 - "E1 answers: 'Which dishes make money?' (forward-looking insights)"
 - **Example:** "Kledo shows revenue Rp 50M, expenses Rp 45M, profit Rp 5M. E1 shows: Nasi Goreng has 40% Food Cost (good), Rendang has 60% Food Cost (too high - supplier issue or portion control problem)."

3. **Price + Simplicity:**
 - "Kledo costs Rp 300-500K/month and requires accounting knowledge. E1 is Rp 200K/month and designed for operators (not accountants)."
 - "Most customers use **both**: Kledo for compliance, E1 for daily operations."

4. **Bundle Opportunity:** "We can integrate with Kledo (import expense data). Use both tools together = complete picture."

**Win Triggers:**
- Operator (not accountant) - doesn't want to learn accounting software
- Operational focus (daily decisions, not month-end reports)
- Budget allows both tools (Kledo Rp 300K + E1 Rp 200K = Rp 500K total)
- Wants actionable insights, not just compliance
