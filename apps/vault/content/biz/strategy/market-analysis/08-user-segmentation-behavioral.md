## Part 1: Firmographic Segmentation

### 1.1 Segment A: Solo Operators (1-2 Outlets)

**Size:** 10,000 businesses (50% of SAM)

**Characteristics:**
- **Outlets:** 1-2 (single location or just opened 2nd)
- **Revenue:** Rp 250M - Rp 2B/year per outlet
- **Staff:** 5-15 people
- **Owner role:** Hands-on (still involved in daily operations)
- **Tech stack:** Basic (POS + Excel + WhatsApp)

**Pain Points:**
1. Time waste on manual Excel (4-8 hours/week)
2. Can't afford junior analyst (Rp 5-8M/month)
3. Tried generic templates, failed (60% failure rate)
4. Don't know which metrics matter

**Buying Behavior:**
- **Decision-maker:** Owner (solo decision, no board approval)
- **Buying process:** Fast (1-2 weeks consideration)
- **Price sensitivity:** High (budget <Rp 5M)
- **Support needs:** High (need hand-holding, not tech-savvy)

**Recommended Product:**
- **Tier:** Tier 1 Essentials (Rp 3.5-4.7M)
- **Modules:** 0-1 (keep it simple)
- **Onboarding:** Self-service (video tutorials, email support)

**Lifetime Value (LTV):**
- **Initial purchase:** Rp 4.7M
- **Upgrade potential:** 20% to Tier 2 within 12 months (if open 2nd outlet)
- **Product 02 attach:** 5% (too price-sensitive for ongoing support)
- **LTV:** Rp 5-6M (initial + potential upgrade)

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- **Channel:** Facebook groups (organic), word-of-mouth
- **CAC:** Rp 500K-1M (low-touch sales, mostly self-serve)

**LTV:CAC Ratio:** 5-6x (healthy)

- **Owner role:** Semi-hands-on (delegating operations, focusing on strategy)
- **Tech stack:** Intermediate (POS + Excel + basic analytics)

**Pain Points:**
1. Multi-outlet consolidation chaos (can't compare outlets)
2. Scaling complexity (what worked for 1 outlet doesn't work for 5)
3. Need data to decide: "Which outlet to replicate? Where to open #6?"
4. Hiring analyst not worth it yet (overhead too high for 5 outlets)

**Buying Behavior:**
- **Decision-maker:** Owner + GM (2-person approval)
- **Buying process:** Medium (2-4 weeks, want demos + case studies)

- **Onboarding:** Guided (2-hour 1:1 setup call)

- **Initial purchase:** Rp 9.5M

- **LTV:** Rp 15-20M (initial + upgrade + 12 months Product 02)

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- **Channel:** POS partnerships, targeted Facebook ads, case studies
- **CAC:** Rp 1.5-2.5M (more hand-holding, demos, proposals)
