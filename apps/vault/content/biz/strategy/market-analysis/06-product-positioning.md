## Market Overview

### The Problem Space

**Indonesian F&B owners are drowning in data they can't use.**

- POS systems generate sales reports  ->  but owners don't know *why* revenue dropped
- Excel spreadsheets track inventory  ->  but food cost % is still a mystery
- Daily cash counting happens  ->  but no forecasting or trend analysis
- Business decisions rely on "gut feel"  ->  competitors with analytics win

### Market Segmentation

We serve **5 distinct customer phases**, each with different analytics maturity:

| Phase | Business Size | Outlets | Tech Savvy | Primary Pain | Price Sensitivity |
|-------|---------------|---------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Mikro (Warung, Kaki Lima) | 1 | Low | Cash tracking chaos | Extreme (Free-only) |
| **Phase 2** | Mikro  ->  Kecil | 1-2 | Medium | No visibility on costs | High (Rp 50-200K/mo) |
| **Phase 3** | Kecil (Small Restaurant) | 2-3 | Medium-High | Manual reporting burden | Medium (Rp 300K-1M/mo) |
| **Phase 4** | Menengah (Multi-outlet) | 4-10 | High | Cross-location insights | Low (Rp 2-5M/mo) |
| **Phase 5** | Enterprise (Chain) | 10+ | Very High | Predictive analytics | Very Low (Rp 8M+/mo) |

## Competitive Positioning

### Competitive Landscape

**We compete differently at each phase.**

#### Phase 1-2: Free Tools & Micro-SaaS
**Competitors:**
- Excel/Google Sheets (free, manual)
- Generic accounting apps (Jurnal, Accurate - overkill for warung)
- POS built-in reports (limited, not actionable)

**Our Advantage:**
- **Free tier exists** (Web Dashboard Lite MVP)
- **Offline-first** (works without stable internet)
- **F&B-specific metrics** (food cost %, item profitability, not generic accounting)
- **WhatsApp integration** (share reports natively)

#### Phase 3-4: Mid-Market SaaS
**Competitors:**
- Moka/Pawoon/Majoo analytics add-ons (Rp 500K-1M/mo, locked to their POS)
- Power BI consultants (Rp 10-20M one-time, requires technical knowledge)
- Generic BI tools (Tableau, Looker - enterprise pricing)

**Our Advantage:**
- **POS-agnostic** (integrate with any system via CSV/API)
- **Templated dashboards** (plug-and-play vs. 3-month consulting projects)
- **Hybrid pricing** (one-time templates + optional subscriptions)
- **Upgrade path** (start with Template, upgrade to SaaS later)

#### Phase 5: Enterprise
**Competitors:**
- Custom BI implementations (Rp 50-100M+)
- ERP systems (SAP, Oracle - massive overkill)
- In-house data teams (hiring 3-5 analysts)

**Our Advantage:**
- **Industry-specific insights** (benchmarking against other F&B chains)
- **Faster time-to-value** (weeks vs. quarters)
- **Ecosystem lock-in** (already using our tools at smaller scale)
