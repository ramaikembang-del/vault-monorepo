# Current State: Scattered Between Sprint 1 & 2
**Status:** 🔄 SCATTERED - Sprint 1 (v0.1.0) done, Sprint 2 not formally started
**What's Happened:** Unintended specification work (PRDs 10-14) completed
**Next:** Formal Sprint 2 start (Foundation Specs for PRDs 00-09)

## 📋 The Vault Sprint Roadmap

**Sprint 1 (v0.1.0):** Rapid Prototype ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- Duration: 4.5h
- Result: Functional prototype (not yet in production)

**Scattered Work:** Unintended Specifications ✅ COMPLETE
- Duration: 4h
- Result: PRDs 10-14 specifications created

**Sprints 2-6:** The Revamp - Ground-Up Rebuild (v0.2.0 → v1.0)
Building production architecture, one sprint at a time:
- **Sprint 2 (v0.2.0) - NEXT:** Foundation Specs (15-20h) ⏳
- **Sprint 3 (v0.4.0):** Core Infrastructure Rebuild (20-25h) ⏳
- **Sprint 4 (v0.6.0):** Biz Lab Rebuild (8-10h) ⏳
- **Sprint 5 (v0.8.0):** Products Lab Build (6-8h) ⏳
- **Sprint 6 (v1.0.0):** Navigation & Settings (12-16h) ⏳

**Sprint 7+:** Advanced features beyond v1.0 core

## 📝 What Was Completed (Scattered Work)

**What Happened:**
During/after Sprint 1, unintended specification work created comprehensive specs for PRDs 10-14. This wasn't formal Sprint 2 work, but it's valuable.

### Specifications Created (4 hours scattered work):

1. **PRD 10: Biz Lab System** ✅
   - Status: Specification complete (2,695 lines)
   - Implementation: Sprint 1 (v0.1.0) has basic version, Sprint 4 will rebuild
   - Contains: MDX pipeline, Knowledge Graph, Strategic Brain, Caching

2. **PRD 11: Products Lab System** ✅
   - Status: Specification complete (1,500+ lines)
   - Implementation: Sprint 5 will build from scratch
   - Contains: My Desk, Component Workbench, Experiments, Design Tokens

3. **PRD 12: Global Navigation System** ✅
   - Status: Specification complete
   - Implementation: Sprint 6 will build
   - Contains: Command Palette, Menu Config, Keyboard Shortcuts

4. **PRD 13: Studio Tuner System** ✅
   - Status: Specification complete
   - Implementation: Sprint 6 will build
   - Contains: Theme Studio, Layout Presets, Accessibility Tools

5. **PRD 14: App Settings System** ✅
   - Status: Specification complete
   - Implementation: Sprint 6 will build
   - Contains: Workflow Profiles, Cascade Engine, App-Specific Settings

### Impact:
- ✅ Sprints 4-6 have complete specifications ready
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces defined for advanced systems
- ✅ Integration patterns documented
- ✅ Documentation cleaned up (5 legacy files handled)

### What's Still Needed:
- [ ] Formal Sprint 2 start - implement features from existing specifications
- [ ] Decision: Deploy v0.1.0 to production or skip to v0.2.0+

**Note:** All specifications already exist in `docs/specifications/`. Sprint 2+ will be about **implementation**, not creating new specs.

## 🎯 Sprint 2+ (v0.2.0+) Work Plan - UPCOMING

**Reality Check:** All specifications already exist in `docs/specifications/`
**Sprint 2+ Goal:** Implement features from existing specifications
**Sprint 2+ Status:** ⏳ NOT STARTED (waiting to formally begin)

**What exists:**
- ✅ core-platform.md (Infrastructure: Auth, Navigation, Deployment)
- ✅ dashboard-system.md (Mission Control Dashboard)
- ✅ biz-lab-system.md (Biz Lab - PRD 10)
- ✅ products-lab-system.md (Products Lab - PRD 11)
- ✅ global-navigation-system.md (PRD 12)
- ✅ studio-tuner-system.md (PRD 13)
- ✅ app-settings-system.md (PRD 14)
- Plus: collaboration-features.md, design-foundation.md, interactive-ui.md

**What Sprint 2+ needs to do:** Implement remaining features from these specs that aren't in v0.1.0 yet
