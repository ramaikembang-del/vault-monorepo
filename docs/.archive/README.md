# Archive Directory
**Legacy documentation files preserved for reference**

---

## Purpose

This directory contains the original large documentation files that have been reorganized into focused, digestible documents. These files are kept for:

1. **Historical reference** - Track how documentation evolved
2. **Comprehensive details** - Original specifications with all code examples
3. **Completeness** - Nothing is deleted, just reorganized

## When to Reference

**Use archived files when:**
- You need the EXACT original wording
- You're looking for code examples not yet extracted
- You want to see the full context of a feature
- You're debugging an implementation discrepancy

**Use new organized files when:**
- You want quick navigation
- You're implementing a specific feature
- You're onboarding new team members
- You need current status information

---

## Redundancy Analysis

**Content overlap between archive and new files:**
- ~60% duplicate (by design - core content preserved)
- ~30% reorganized (same info, better structure)
- ~10% unique to archives (historical context, rejected ideas)

**Why keep archives:**
- Documentation integrity (nothing lost)
- Audit trail (track changes)
- Edge case reference (obscure details)
